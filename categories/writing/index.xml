      <description>Atomic Habits probably needs no introduction, and neither will I bore you with one. All I&amp;rsquo;ll say is that I found a friend in hostel with a copy of the book, and when I went home, I found a physical copy on my Dad&amp;rsquo;s bookshelf (all of us have kindles, and only buy hardcopies of books that we really want a hardcopy of).
So What&amp;rsquo;s the fuss about Like it&amp;rsquo;s predecessors, Atomic Habits preaches more of the same old myelination tricks</description>

      <description>Once every year, when the sun beats down
Students here become clowns
They think on their command, people will fall
But truly, they&amp;rsquo;re just bricks in the wall
Misled by the mirage of power
Led astray till they flounder
&amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re barely 20! What do you think will change
When you become Secretary, like others who&amp;rsquo;ve aged&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you! Here&amp;rsquo;s my manifesto:
It says I&amp;rsquo;m great with a budget
I&amp;rsquo;m smart, hardworking, and totally not a puppet</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;rsquo;t done one of these in a year or so (this was the previous one), and neither have I written content exclusively for my blog for atleast a few months now, so it&amp;rsquo;s a good time to do one of these because a lot has changed in the past one year.
Let&amp;rsquo;s start with summer The past two months have been amazing.
That doesn&amp;rsquo;t even sum up just how great they&amp;rsquo;ve been.</description>

      <title>How it Happened</title>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Baba, I got Mathematics and Computing Dual at IITD&amp;rdquo;, I told my father excitedly on the day the first round allocations were over. &amp;ldquo;It probably won&amp;rsquo;t change now&amp;rdquo;. Certain of this, I returned back to whatever I was doing, excitedly waiting for the seat allocations to get over (while simultaneously crossing my fingers for the slightest hope of a branch upgrade, as we all do). Even though the campus was not opening and the semester was planned to be conducted online, I hoped to truly enjoy my first year of college life.</description>

      <description>What is a dream? all of us think of dreams as abstract ideals, far removed from reality, that we should chase with all the effort we can muster every day.
Meditating on this a bit more, does this make sense? What is achieved by chasing an ideal when you can never reach it? also, what would you do if you reached the ideal? Would you just stop? Life would lose all it&amp;rsquo;s meaning, and the only place to go then would be out of a tall window.</description>

      <description>Soft sunlight streaked in through the curtains, illuminating the room in a warm glow. Of course, I noticed none of that. The only thing I was aware of was my phone&amp;rsquo;s alarm clock ringing. After drowsily hitting the snooze button, I realized that I had done this twice already, so I started scrolling through the notifications. It was 8:30, and my friends were abuzz with excitement. &amp;ldquo;Oh! The JEE Advanced results are coming out today!</description>
