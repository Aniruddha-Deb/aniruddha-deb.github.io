      <description>I think an update on the JEE Situation has been due for a long time, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to compress the past few months into this single post. Long story short, my JEE(M) was held on 2nd September, in the evening shift. After giving my best and getting a 260/300, I was disappointed (putting it mildly) to see the CRL of 1861 on my screen.

A lot has been said about Concepts of Physics by Dr. H. C.Verma and it&amp;rsquo;s usefulness for JEE Preparation. The website itself claims that
Students from the past twenty years of JEE preparation used this book and have successfully cleared JEE. So, you cannot neglect this book. A common problem that was observed with many JEE aspirants is that they follow multiple books in parallel, thereby ending up in confusion.</description>
