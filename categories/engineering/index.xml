      <description>MCP100 is a course that all first year undergrads in IITD have to go through. It consists of two parts: the first part is engineering drawing, using rulers and pencils, and CAD. After a disastrous drawing minor, the next phase involved getting to terms with CAD. The CAD package our course instructor decided on was FreeCAD, and since the minor ended, I&amp;rsquo;ve done nothing but create FreeCAD models.
I&amp;rsquo;m not a pero1 at it though, (there&amp;rsquo;s still plenty to learn), and once that is done, there are plenty of bugs to fix :P.</description>
