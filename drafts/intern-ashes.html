<p>In the weekends of my internship, and in the days that followed, I got to tour 
Europe a bit. What follows is a small travelogue of my experiences in these
two months</p>
<h2>Stroopwaffel</h2>
<p>Optiver gave us a goodie bag when we arrived, and among other things, it 
contained a box of Stroopwaffel!</p>
<!-- stroopwaffel pic -->

<p>Stroopwaffel are really thin waffles filled with caramel, and they taste
amazing! The bag was also filled with other things to see and do in Amsterdam, 
and in typical college student fashion, I did none of those.</p>
<h3>Den Haag</h3>
<p>The first weekend getaway was The Hague (<em>Den Haag</em> in Dutch), and it seemed
like a quieter, less crowded version of Amsterdam.</p>
<ul>
<li>Madurodam</li>
<li>Beach</li>
<li>Escher in het Paleis</li>
<li>Lunch</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rotterdam</h3>
<p>Rotterdam is the more modern cousin of Amsterdam, who always wears trackpants
and mirrored sunglasses. Rotterdam is filled with skyscrapers, even more than Amsterdam,
and with amazing bridges</p>
<ul>
<li>Erasmusburg</li>
</ul>
<p>Erasmus bridge was the first bridge we saw, made popular </p>
<ul>
<li>Euromast</li>
</ul>
<h3>Zandvoort</h3>
<ul>
<li>Beach</li>
<li>Classic car GP sneak in</li>
</ul>
<h3>Amsterdam</h3>
<ul>
<li>Canal stroll</li>
<li>Centraal comic book shopping</li>
<li>Mokumboot</li>
<li>Park walk</li>
</ul>
<h2>Waffles</h2>
<!--waffles vedang-->

<p>The next stop on one of the weekends was Belgium</p>
<ul>
<li>Booking cancelled</li>
<li>Antwerp Museum</li>
<li>Zaha Hadidplein</li>
<li>Grotemarkt and Cathedral</li>
<li>Lunch</li>
<li>Back</li>
</ul>
<h1>Post Internship</h1>
<p>I had booked my return flight on sixth noon, which gave me four and a half days 
to backpack across Europe. This was as close to <em>Zindagi na Milegi Dobara</em> as 
I'll get to in my life: being a young twentysomething in Europe, with enough 
money to backpack across it, and having friends to do it with won't happen
every year, after all :)</p>
<p>I had to take care of my luggage first. Fortunately, Schiphol Airport will store 
your luggage for you at a reasonable cost of €9 per 24 hours per bag. After 
lugging my one suitcase down to the luggage hold with a friend, all we had to 
do was board the night bus to Paris!</p>
<h2>Crepes</h2>
<!--crepes vedang-->

<p>Paris smells sweetly smoky. It's the same smell as the scented cigarettes
everyone smokes so fashionably, just softer. Paris Bercy-Seine bus stop, 
however, smells of pee as well. It's worse than an Indian train station when 
it comes to sanitation. It was also raining when we arrived at 6 AM, and having
to wait there for an hour and twenty minutes for a friend to arrive was <em>the 
most romantic introduction to the city of romance a romantic could dream about</em>.</p>
<p>After regrouping, we went to the Metro. I won't launch into a full-fledged rant 
about the metro station (have saved that for later), but </p>
<p>The night bus took us to </p>
<ul>
<li>Tuilleries</li>
<li>Louvre (from outside)</li>
<li>Palais Garnier</li>
<li>Tour Eiffel</li>
<li>Pantheon</li>
<li>Japanese food</li>
<li>Crepes</li>
</ul>
<h3>Ver-sai</h3>
<p>The Japanese Lunch was followed by a stroll down to the train station. After
much googling (and going to the wrong station and asking around), we finally 
found the train to Versailles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Palace of mirrors</li>
<li>Garden</li>
<li>KFC</li>
</ul>
<h3>Pah-ree at night</h3>
<p>After coming back, we got off the train and had to take a metro with a 
switch-over to reach our hotel. Paris has the worst metro system of any city I
have been to. It's a bunch of matchboxes on tyres (yes, rubber tyres) hurtling
at insane speeds through metre-wide tracks strewn across the city like a kitty
that clawed through it's ball of yarn. You can't even go from one matchbox to
the other, because the carriages are not connected internally. Buses and trams
were also closed when we were in the city because of the riots, and the entire
populace decided to use the metro on Saturday Night. It was breathtaking, as in
my breath was literally taken away after being squeezed among people. Peak
Delhi Metro rush has got nothing on this.</p>
<p>There was a woman who had married the Eiffel 
Tower<sup><a href='#footnote-1'>1</a></sup>, and it's easy to see why.
It's truly a thing of beauty, especially at night when it's lit up. It lights
up slowly at sunset, going from a dull red to a bright yellow, almost as if 
the cast iron beams were put in an induction furnace. And if it couldn't get any
better, It burst into sparkles at 11 PM in the night,</p>
<p>The Eiffel tower viewing was followed by Crepes at a store nearby: The crepe
maker took his time with the crepes, pouring the dough only when they were 
ordered and never making them en masse. He used a thin squeegee, the kind used 
to wash windows to make them. While the crepes were amazing, I still think my 
mother makes better and flatter <em>dosas</em> with her <em>ultana</em> than the crepe maker
made with his sophisticated tooling :)</p>
<p>The following day, we had to set off to the airport for our flight to Napoli. 
Breakfast at the hotel was just 3 euros, but it was the best croissant I've 
eaten in my life. It was super soft, and the pastry was not flaky at all. It was 
also very hollow on the inside, so you could tear it in half and stuff it with 
butter and jam. It's a shame I realized on the last day just how good Parisian
Croissants are, and I would've loved to try out a <em>boulangerie</em> if I had more 
time <sub>and if they spoke English</sub></p>
<h3>To Paris, with Love</h3>
<p>I did notice a few things while in Paris: The person from whom we brought the 
Eiffel tower souvenir was Black, the person whose cart we approached first 
to grab a crepe was Turkish, and the person serving breakfast at our hotel was
Indian. This makes Paris seem like a very diverse city, but when you notice
that every single person selling Eiffel tower souvenirs was black and every
single cart-owner was Turkish, things look a bit darker (no pun intended). It's 
the sort of thing that won't strike you, until you have friends and family tell 
you that Paris was being rocked by the most violent riots since 2005, after 
a policeman shot a boy of color dead for a traffic offence. Then, the invisible
walls between people become all too clear, and the homogenity breaks down. I 
was fortunately unaffected by the riots, but I pray that things change for the 
better as soon as possible, and that the people of the city of love learn 
to love each other for what they are rather than how they look.</p>

<p>That's been it. I know this is not the latest edition of Conde Nast Traveller,
so I'll refrain from writing a cheesy editor's note, but I'm quite pleased with
how this article turned out. Travelling and seeing the world is a good
way to break assumptions (A lot of mine did break), curb your impulsivity and
increase your tolerance (dealing with delayed flights and staying in shady
places does teach you that). As an added bonus, here's a short animation of my
trip, Indiana Jones style.</p>
