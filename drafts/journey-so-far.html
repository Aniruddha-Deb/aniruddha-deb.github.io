    <p>// Skip intro if aadya introduces me.
Hi! I'm Aniruddha, a Second-year undergraduate in the Computer Science Department at IIT Delhi. </p>
<p>So before I begin with my topic, I heard that a lot of you aren't enrolled in a coaching institute. That's great, because I wasn't too! I continued in the same school I used to go to in tenth for my eleventh and twelfth, and I would study for JEE from my home. I'll take a small diversion and say that there are three main things a coaching institute does: Teaching, Training and Mentorship. The easiest to replace and do yourself (unlike what most people think) is Teaching: you just need to read the right books, pay attention in class and have clear concepts and fundamentals. Training involves solving a lot of problems and tests, and you can train yourself again with JEE problem books (there are a lot of them in the market). As for tests, you can enroll in a test series. The last and probably the most scarce is mentorship: this is absolutely not an issue for you, because you're being mentored by the best people here at IIT itself. So if you ever feel that you need to pay a large sum of money for coaching because it gives you an advantage, think again.</p>
<p>But coming back to my main topic: How the IIT Experience shapes your career. How many of you are sure of what you want to do in life? 
// ask people to tell what they want to be in their future. It's ok to say you don't know
// If people are not receptive, do a show of hands eg how many of you want to be engineers, doctors, lawyers, artists, musicians, actors etc</p>
<p>That's great. It's great to see so many of you already know what you want to do. I'll tell you a secret: if you meet first year undergraduates at IIT and ask them what they want to do, most of them will say "I don't know". Surprising? You'd think that all of them gave JEE and are studying engineering, so they'll all want to be engineers. Let me tell you another secret: That's perfectly fine. In fact, that's a good thing!</p>
<p>Let's look at this from another perspective: What are you passionate about? Tell me your interests, hobbies, anything you really enjoy doing and have been doing. 
// ask people what they're passionate about. It's ok to say studies if you really like studying
// again, if people are not receptive, do a show of hands</p>
<p>Very good, so everyone's passionate about something. Now, if you do the same thing with first year undergraduates at IIT (ask them what they're passionate about), every single person will have something different to say. Some will say they're very interested in making a startup, whereas some will say that they want to pursue dramatics and acting. Some will say they really enjoy what they're studying here, and some will say they enjoy finance and looking at the market everyday. Most of them will be exploring multiple things, and enjoying themselves while doing so.</p>
<p>So do you see the difference here? The most important thing an IIT gives you is not the tag, or the placements, interns and all the other opportunities here. They're all bonuses; added benefits of being here. What an IIT gives you is a platform. A platform of deeply passionate people, with whom you can truly find out where you want life to take you.</p>
<p>You're passionate about business and startups? You'll find eDC, SHARE, Economics club, and economics courses here</p>
<p>You're passionate about technology and making things? You'll find axlr8r, hyperloop and DevClub.</p>
<p>You're passionate about studying more? You'll find amazing facilities, labs and professors to help guide you.</p>
<p>You're passionate about social impact and helping others? You'll find RuTAG, NSS and Enactus</p>
<p>You're passionate about something completely different, like drama, dance, photography or music? You have clubs for all of them, filled with amazing actors, dancers, photographers and musicians, who can give formal art college students a run for their money.</p>
<p>You'll probably ask 'What's the difference between an IIT and other colleges in this aspect? Other colleges have the same clubs, and the same number of people passionate about those clubs as well!' The reality is that they don't. At an IIT, there is always someone better than you, at anything. More importantly, that someone who is better than you is always willing to teach you. It's an incredible environment, and the sheer intensity with which people here go about pursuing anything they set their mind to is what sets the people at IIT apart from the people at any other college.</p>
<p>Sarrah and Stuti will be covering more about different clubs, platforms and committees here, and the people involved in them, in their speeches. Personally, I'll share my story here. When I entered, career wise, I was sure that I'm academically inclined, and I wanted to pursue Computer Science: I had been programming from a young age and I liked making utilities and websites that my friends or others would use. However, like most others, I wasn't sure where this would lead me, other than to an IIT degree. Like most others, in 11th and 12th, I had been caught up in getting here, rather than thinking about what to do after I make it here. </p>
