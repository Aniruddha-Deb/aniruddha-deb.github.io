    <p>Happy Republic Day! Here's to 74 years of India having a constitution, and to
a brighter future!</p>
<p><em>coughs in Delhi pollution</em></p>
<p>Anyway, with how polarized the country, and the world in general is at this
point, it's hard to see that happening. The only thing I read in newspapers now
is who's going right and who's going left; if I replaced google maps with these
random navigation snippets from the news, I would have reached Goa by now.</p>
<h2>Mo people, Mo problems</h2>
<p>We're now the <a href="https://thediplomat.com/2023/01/india-is-the-worlds-most-populous-country-what-it-means/">most populated country</a>
in the world. It's easy to blame all your problems at the number of people 
you're surrounded by: I never get a nice spot to park my cycle at LHC, a window
seat at the library, or a single room in my hostel (was the norm 25 years ago,
still is at IISc). However, there's no way to fix this, other than brainwashing
people into believing that sex sucks (Maybe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Clockwork_Orange_(novel)#Part_2:_The_Ludovico_Technique">Ludovico Technique</a> 
would work?). </p>
<p>So let's take a cue from every philosophy/religion of the world instead</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you can't change the world, change yourself</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>How do we approach life?</h2>
<p>Have a value system and a moral compass. The value system will guide your 
major decisions in life and anchor you, and the moral compass is your objective
sense of what is 'right' and what is 'wrong'. Everything else: your hobbies,
likes, dislikes, interests, etc are addons on top of this basic framework.</p>
<h2>This is too complicated. Is God the answer?</h2>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>To many questions, for most people. <strong>Just not for everything.</strong></p>
<p>A distinction most of the devout are unable to make is between fatalism and
determinism. In simple terms, the fatalist believes God is the answer to all
his problems in life; even those that arise from his mistakes. The determinist
believes that everything in his life is because of his actions, which have had
the good fortune of being blessed by the almighty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In simpler terms, if we have two doctors, the fatalist would do a terrible job
and claim "I have treated you; God will heal you now", whereas the determinist
would do a great job and say "I haven't treated you; God did. I only (wrote the
prescriptions/cut and tied things/drilled holes)".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course, there are many variations of this, but <strong>fatalists hold God accountable
for fixing their actions</strong>. I won't comment on which one is a better practice,
but it's obvious. The primary benefits of divinity are keeping your philosophy
and approach towards life humble and stable: believing in yourself when times
are tricky, and believing a little less in yourself when times are good. </p>
<p>Aside: It doesn't matter whether you're a fatalist or determinist, be thankful
to God that neither doctor is a nihilist: the nihilist would say "You're doomed.
Pray to god that the rest of your days are pain-free."</p>
<h2>How do I answer the questions God won't?</h2>
<p>There's no good answer to this, but let me tell you what you shouldn't do.</p>
<p><strong>Don't believe blindly in anyone</strong>.</p>
<p>You're not the only one with questions: people without their philosophies in 
place have more questions than you do. With so many questions and not enough
answers, polarization starts to take place: those with a platform can broadcast
answers that are not neccessarily right, but are more satisfying, and polarize
people's value systems.</p>
<p>If you claim that none of this is happening, Why have Jordan Peterson and Andrew
Tate entered the common lexicon, and why has taking the red pill or cancelling
someone/something, or even not being able to abort a pregnancy become so common? 
These are objectively bad and probably inhumane things (In a neutral frame of
reference).</p>
<p>The only reason for this I can think of is that they give the
most satisfying answer to questions that people have right now: questions such
as "Why don't women date me" or "What do we do with XYZ if they did this 
socially unacceptable thing which wasn't morally wrong". Questions that the 
insecure, vulnerable and lonely have. These answers prey on the insecurities and
make the platforms of the preachers even bigger. We've seen it happen with the
Church of England and The Pope. This is merely the resurgence of moral support,
but developed society now has achieved most things in the hierarchy of needs,
and all of these questions are tied to self-actualization. Combine that with
the falling out of the principles of religion with the modern times 
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1_Timothy_2:12">1 Timothy 2:12</a>) and you can
see where this is headed. Most dystopias come to mind, but one very real
example dealing with this was <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/how-mouse-utopias-1960s-led-grim-predictions-humans-180954423/">Universe 25</a>.</p>
<h2>What next?</h2>
<p>My Operating Systems Assignment.</p>
<p>Seriously; my contemporaries <a href="https://basil08.github.io/post/">don't post as much as they used to</a>,
and in a world of tweets and reels, I doubt anyone retains the attention span
neccessary to read what I write. I have a lot of time on my hands if I can
write so frequently here, so I should probably remove 'busy' from my WhatsApp
status now :)</p>
<p>Jokes aside, I think this is probably too preachy, so take it with a grain of
salt. We'll have to wait and watch what happens in the next ten years to find
out where society is headed.</p>
