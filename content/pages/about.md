Title: About

I'm currently a sophomore undergraduate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cse.iitd.ac.in) at [Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in). My research interests are whatever sounds interesting to me :P but so far, I've dabbled (to varying degrees) in Probability, Statistics, Stochastic Processes, Machine Learning (Decision trees, SVM's, regression and clustering models, time series analysis), Blockchain, Modelling and Simulation, Computational Complexity and Proof Checking, Systems development and more recently, Game Theory and it's various subfields (Algorithmic, Combinatorial, Economic), Functional Programming and Computer Architecture and Organisation.

When I'm not glued to my laptop, I quiz, read, write, sketch and binge anime. I'm good at shuffling cards, better at folding T-Shirts and unbeatable at sharpening pencils. If you have some book/anime recommendations or some interesting facts, reach out to me on email :)
