Title: About

I'm a Junior Undergraduate in the <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in">Computer Science and Engineering</a> Department at <a href="https://home.iitd.ac.in">IIT Delhi</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.scholarships.reliancefoundation.org/">Reliance Foundation Scholar in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Sciences</a>. Prior to this, I was a student at <a href="https://www.thebishopsschool.org">The Bishop's School, Pune</a>.</p>

Being an undergraduate, I have the luxury to explore and change my academic interests from semester to semester, and from course to course :P At the moment, I'm interested in Neuroimaging and Algorithmic Game Theory, with a bit of Computational Social Choice. I'm currently advised by <a href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~rahulgarg/">Prof. Rahul Garg</a>, and am working towards the Summer Undergraduate Research Award.</p>

Apart from this, I've been a volunteer teacher for NSS, an Academic Mentor for MTL100, a runner-up in <a href="http://mimamsa.iiserpune.ac.in/">Mimamsa 2021</a>, a journalist at the <a href="https://www.bspiitd.com/">Board for Student Publications</a>, a Representative for the <a href="https://qciitdelhi.netlify.app">Quizzing Club</a> and a convenor of the Debating Society (albeit for a very short time).</p>
