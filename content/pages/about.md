Title: About

Hi! Nice seeing you here

I'm a Junior Undergraduate in the Computer Science Department at IIT Delhi. While I'm not buried under mountains of coursework, I write a bit :)

For more boring stuff about me, you can visit my other website [here](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~cs1200869). 

Fun Fact: Octopuses have beaks. Yep, just like birds.
