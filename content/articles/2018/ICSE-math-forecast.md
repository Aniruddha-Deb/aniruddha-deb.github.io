A speculative format for the 2018 ICSE Mathematics paper, created by analysis of the mathematics question papers of the past 23 years. The boards are fast approaching and hope this helps out those in need.

Best of luck for the exams!

EDIT: As of 16th June, 2018, I cleared the 2018 ICSE Mathematics paper with a perfect 100. The above statistical analysis truly paid off as most of the questions followed the same pattern :D
