The Previous COVID regression analysis was fairly accurate. However, the opening of lockdown offset the statistics a bit and now there are more number of projected cases. Here is a recomputation of the statistics, which projects an average of 172,000 cases by June 1 and 520,000 cases overall by August end.

UPDATE: As of May 30 9:30 pm, The recorded cases are ~174,000. I was assuming a ~10% error margin on this prediction, but I ended up being quite close to the number. The final number of cases are expected to be ~181,000 by 31st May night, resulting in an error margin of 4.1%.
