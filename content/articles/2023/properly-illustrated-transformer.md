![That's a f@!#ton of dropouts](/articles/2023/res/transformer_no_ws.svg)

----

The title is (obviously) a shout out to [Jay Alammar's Blog](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/),
which is probably the best source to learn about transformers, followed by
[The Annotated Transformer](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/annotated-transformer/).
Both of them are unclear about the nuances though (where the dropouts are mostly),
     and so I made this to clear that up.

PS: Yes, this is just the encoder stack. I'll probably make the decoder stack
in a part 2?
