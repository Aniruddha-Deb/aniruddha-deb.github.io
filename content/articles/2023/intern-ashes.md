In the weekends of my internship, and in the days that followed, I got to tour 
Europe a bit. What follows is a small travelogue of my experiences in these
two months<sup><a href='#footnote-1'>1</a></sup>, 

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/articles/2023/res/center_captions.css">

## Stroopwaffel

Optiver gave us a goodie bag when we arrived, and among other things, it 
contained a box of Stroopwaffel!

![Gardens of Versailles](/articles/2023/res/stroopwaffel.jpg)

Stroopwaffel are really thin waffles filled with caramel, and they taste
amazing! The bag was also filled with other things to see and do in Amsterdam, 
and in typical college student fashion, I did none of those. 

### No Tulips

All but one of my IITD batchmates got away to see the Tulips when they landed,
and for good reason: Sunday was the last day Keukenhof would be open! 
Unfortunately my flight was delayed by an hour and even ignoring the jetlag and 
fatigue, it was not something I wanted to do after a 9-hour flight.

The first thing that hits you is that Amsterdam is windy. I don't mean 'stiff breeze'
windy, I mean upturn-your-umbrella windy. And chilly. The only way to stay warm 
is to have a good jacket or stay in the sunlight. Which there's a lot of, 
considering sunset happens at 9:30-10:00 PM in the summers.

The first thing I did was walk down for lunch. Europe is beautiful as long as
your eyes don't look at the ground: beautiful trees, lot of greenery, very
walkable roads with wide sidewalks for both cycles and people and large
well-marked crosswalks. Looking down, you're greeted with the umpteen butts of
cigarettes people stamp out. It's truly a luxury to be able to smoke: if
breathing the air doesn't eventually kill you, why don't you do it a favour and
speeden up the process?

Another beautiful thing about Europe is the road rules. The first three crossings
I waited at all had the cars come to a stop and gesture me to cross. It was only
at the fourth crossing, a small cycle-lane that this sweet old grandma slowed 
down and said in English, "You have the way!". Wow, I didn't know that! Thank
you, kind granny!

Only after getting back to my room and googling did I realize that pedestrians
have the way everywhere: pedestrians > cycles > cars in Amsterdam. Amazing. The
only bad thing about this is that I would have to unlearn this in India, and not
doing so would be fatal. Quite literally.

But enough about rules. Let's go somewhere!

### Den Haag

The first weekend getaway was The Hague (_Den Haag_ in Dutch), and it seemed
like a quieter, less crowded version of Amsterdam. The Netherlands is a tiny 
country, and insanely well-connected by rail: you can go from one end to
another in less than 2 hours, and the trains themselves are incredible. 

After arriving, We grabbed an early-morning sausage roll from the Albert Heijn
at the station and strolled aimlessly through the streets early in the morning,
deciding where to go. The first stop was Madurodam. How tourist-y!

![madurodam](/articles/2023/res/madurodam.jpg)

I would have assumed Madurodam is an amusement park, if not for the infographic
about it being a war memorial at the start. It was made in memory of [George
Maduro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Maduro), a Dutch war hero. It's an 
amazing park, and even at 9 AM in the morning, it was overrun by Gujarati 
tourists. An interesting distinction I noticed was that the Gujarati
tourists would take pictures of anything and everything, including themselves
while the European tourists were just chilling with their partners and children.

Madurodam also reminded me of the Doraemon episode where Suneo went to Holland
on a tour, and boasted about it to everyone. He also unfortunately lost his
camcorder there. Nobita goes to Doraemon and says that he wants a Holland tour
too. Doraemon comes up with a gadget that shows them scenes of any place in the
world live, and he invites all his friends to his home. As Doraemon shows them
the scenes in Holland (Madurodam, canals etc), Suniyo sulks while Nobita is
very happy. Soon, they come across a bench with a camcorder on it and they zoom
in, and it turns out it's Suneo's camcorder. Suneo leaps at the camcorder, only
to punch a hole through Nobita's sliding door and break the gadget, and not get
his camcorder back. <strike>If you know this episode's name and have a link to it, 
please let me know; Google is clueless and ChatGPT hallucinates</strike>

EDIT: This is Season 6, Episode 34 (No. 778), [The Sight Seeing Window](https://anime.stackexchange.com/questions/68178/doraemon-episode-where-suneo-goes-to-holland-on-tour).
The original Japanese version is [here](https://archive.org/details/doraemon-1979-994-stories/Doraemon+(1979)+-+JP+RAW/TV+Anime/Doraemon+(1979)+-+Story+0778+(EX-CS2).mp4), 
while a dubbed Hindi version can be found [here](https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8mau7o) :)

The next stop after Madurodam was the Beach! We didn't step into the water because
it was super cold for May, and the beach was mostly empty as well. We walked 
around (under?) the pier, took some pictures and enjoyed the breeze. 

![beach](/articles/2023/res/hague_beach.jpg)
*Cold water, colder wind*

Next stop after that was Escher in het Paleis (Escher in the Palace). An 
interesting thing about European culture is that they believe you when you tell 
them you're students: I wasn't asked to prove this explicitly (ok, maybe at the
Antwerp museum and the Vatican Museum). Everywhere else, it was basically a free
pass. Back on topic: Escher in the Palace was definetly the highlight of this
trip, and probably the best museum experience I've had. It was slow-moving, 
you could take your time with the portraits, get as close as you wanted to and
most of them were originals! My first brush with Escher was on the screensavers
of the nook I used to own back when I was a kid, and it was amazing to finally
see all of his work up close.

Soon after, we dropped down to the city center for lunch and took the train to 
our next stop that evening

### Rotterdam

Rotterdam is the more modern cousin of Amsterdam, who always wears trackpants
and mirrored sunglasses. Rotterdam is filled with skyscrapers that you need to 
crane your neck to look at, and amazing bridges. It's a shame, then, that their
metro system doesn't support using credit cards, and that you need to buy a 
ticket using WiFi. Since we had exhausted our mobile data and my battery was 
near-dead, we totally did not travel on that tram without a ticket. Believe me.

![erasmus bridge](/articles/2023/res/rotterdam.jpg)
*Erasmus bridge*

![euromast](/articles/2023/res/euromast.jpg)
*Euromast*

The only places we got a chance to visit here were Erasmusbrug and Euromast. We 
dropped down to a bar just below Erasmusbrug and asked them for a glass of tap 
water, and they obliged :) refreshed, we then walked across Erasmusbrug and 
back. There was a small section of the bridge that was filled with locks: couples
would add a lock to a rung to signify their love wouldn't break until the lock
did. Cute concept <3

After walking back, we took the tram to Euromast. There were two tickets: one 
that took you to the observation deck, and one that would seat you in a torus and 
take you all the way up the mast. Going up to the observation deck is good enough,
because there's a huge line that loops all the way around for going up.

![rotterdam](/articles/2023/res/euromast_view.jpg)
*The view from the observation deck*

After Euromast, since everything was closing down, we sat in the park next to 
it in the setting sun for 30 minutes, enjoying the breeze and nature. Soon after,
we boarded the train back to Amsterdam.

### Zandvoort

After the Belgium weekend, sometime in June when the sun was more abundant with 
it's gifts, we visited Zandvoort beach to surf. With high hopes, we entered the
surf shack to rent some equipment, only to find out that their instructor had
just come out of the water because of no waves. We were advised to pass till 
there were more waves or come back on a later day :(

So we did the next best thing: went and waded in the water :) after half an 
hour of wading in the waves (the water was too shallow to swim), we came out 
and lay on the beach, soaking in the sun<sup><a href='#footnote-2'>2</a></sup>.
Then we had some ice-cream, dried up and set off for the circuit. The circuit 
had a Classic Car Grand Prix underway, and the roars of the engines could be 
heard all the way from the beach. Since it was almost over, we managed to get
in without tickets (like the amateur backpackers we were), and when we reached,
it was truly a sight to see and hear. What followed was ten minutes of our
ears being ripped off our head. Classic cars = Big roaring V12's and V10's = 
Lots of sound. It was pure petrolhead bliss to sit there and hear those beasts
roar around the circuit.

The post-race podium featured a procession of the cars that participated, and 
there were also some classic beauties parked around the paddock.

*Henri Toivonen's Lancia 037*

![Ferrari](/articles/2023/res/wolfgang_trips_ferrari.jpg)
*Wolfgang von Trips' Ferrari 156 'sharknose'*

We then took the train back to Haarlem, then the bus from Haarlem back to 
Amsterdam. I had marinated some Chicken with the hopes of making Tandoori, and
the other folks bought some pizza/pasta from the nearby store. We then chilled
in my room, watching F1 Qualifying and cooking / eating Tandoori Chicken.

![Tandoori](/articles/2023/res/tandoori_chicken.jpg)

### Amsterdam

![Amsterdam](/articles/2023/res/amsterdam.jpg)

Amsterdam itself is an amazing city, and like every city-dweller, I didn't visit
the tourist spots in the city itself. I've heard that the Rijksmuseum is very
good, as is the Van Gogh Museum. Several other interns also went to the Heineken
Experience, but I don't drink so that was off the cards.

My routine in Amsterdam mostly boiled down to cycling to work, working, cycling
back and then going for a stroll along the canal nearby. I stayed at 
Wibautstraat, and I would walk a kilometre or two along the canal most days, 
enjoying the breeze and the scenic beauty.

The parks are also great places to visit, and most weekends were 
spent either staying in and working on something fun, cooking and enjoying
the sun in the park nearby. We also took a Mokumboot on the canals one day with
a bunch of snacks for a couple of hours, and it was great.

## Waffles

![waffles](/articles/2023/res/waffles.jpg)

We visited Belgium on one of the weekends: the plan was to stay over at Antwerp
for a night, but our BnB host had a water infiltration and we got to know of
this only after we had already boarded the bus to Antwerp. In typical undergrad
fashion, we decided to take things as they come and deal with this later.

The Bus dropped us off close to the city center, and the first thing we did 
was grab some waffles and stroll along the coast. We came across a small fort 
on the coast. Then realizing the Museum Aan de Stroom was close by, we continued
to walk along that street, reaching MAS in 10 minutes. 

![mas](/articles/2023/res/mas.jpg)
*Museum aan de Stroom*

The MAS is beautifully constructed; the windows are along the staircase / floors
internally that take you up the building, and every floor is dedicated to one 
aspect of Antwerp: the port, the people, Belgium, and so on. It feels very much
like a classical museum, but this also makes it a bit boring to be inside of. 
The MAS is capped off with an observation deck, which gives you a 360-degree 
view of Antwerp.

![antwerp](/articles/2023/res/antwerp.jpg)
*Antwerp from the top of MAS*

We left MAS and then decided to visit the Port authority building. Not 
realizing that it's huge, and that it's farther than it looks, our strategy of
walking in the direction of the building was a) exhausting, and b) frusturating. 
We finally opened Google maps to see that it was a decently long walk (~3 km) 
to the building. Not giving up, we started walking and finally made it!

Only to find out that it's closed on Saturdays. It's anyway a government
building, so they wouldn't have let us in. Sour grapes.

![Port Authority Building](/articles/2023/res/zaha_hadidplein.jpg)
*Port Authority Building. Designed by Zaha Hadid.*

After this walk, we had little time to spend, and the prospects of rooming up
with the other group visiting Brussels were also growing slim, so we decided to
take the afternoon bus back to Amsterdam. We then came back to the city centre
and looked around the Cathedral and Grotemarkt.

![grotemarkt](/articles/2023/res/grotemarkt.jpg)
*Grotemarkt*

This was followed by Lunch and some Belgian chocolate shopping, after which we
took the subway to the bus stop and took the bus back to Amsterdam.

# Post Internship

I had booked my return flight on sixth noon, which gave me four and a half days 
to backpack across Europe. This was as close to _Zindagi na Milegi Dobara_ as 
I'll get to in my life: being a young twentysomething in Europe, with enough 
money to backpack across it, and having friends to do it with won't happen
every year, after all :)

I had to take care of my luggage first. Fortunately, Schiphol Airport will store 
your luggage for you at a reasonable cost of €9 per 24 hours per bag. After 
lugging my one suitcase down to the luggage hold with a friend, all we had to 
do was board the night bus to Paris!

## Crepes

![crepe](/articles/2023/res/crepe.jpg)

Paris smells sweetly smoky. It's the same smell as the scented cigarettes
everyone smokes so fashionably, just softer. Paris Bercy-Seine bus stop, 
however, smells of pee as well. It's worse than an Indian train station when 
it comes to sanitation. It was also raining when we arrived at 6 AM, and having
to wait there for an hour and twenty minutes for a friend to arrive was _the 
most romantic introduction to the city of romance a romantic could dream about_.

After regrouping, we went to the Metro. I won't launch into a full-fledged rant 
about the metro (have saved that for later), but Paris uses these arcane ticket-
checking machines that won't accept your card. We took a day-pass for the metro,
and then had breakfast at McDonalds (the quantity wasn't great).

Since it was still drizzling, the first plan of action was to get out at Charles
de Gaulle and roam around Central Paris a bit. We visited the Tuilleries Gardens
first, then since the Louvre was close by, we saw it from the outside.

![Louvre](/articles/2023/res/louvre.jpg)
*Louvre from outside. The line to go in had a one hour delay, and needed tickets.*

I don't remember what the plan after that was, but our bags were too heavy and 
the rain was as well, so we went to the nearest metro station and checked in 
our luggage at the hotel. The hotel was in a nice spot, so we left and strolled
through the streets of Paris. They were quite narrow, and uphill at times. With
the help of Google maps, we finally managed to come to this beautiful building

![Pantheon](/articles/2023/res/pantheon.jpg)
*Pantheon*

After that we dropped down to a Japanese place nearby for lunch, and then 
went back to strolling. We walked across some bridges on the Seine, and then 
past the Notre-Dame, which was still being reconstructed. Then we went to the 
Palais Garnier via metro.

![Garnier Palace](/articles/2023/res/palais_garnier.jpg)
*Palais Garnier, Ballroom*

The Palais Garnier was... Palatial, for lack of a better adjective. It adjoined
the Opera, and had these amazing balconies where people were mostly clicking
pictures. There was also an Opera Exhibit nearby, where they showed costumes 
that the actors at the Opera wore. It's a very short trip around the palace,
and well worth the time we spent.

### Ver-sai

The first thing we had done after arriving was book tickets to the Palace of 
Versailles for 4:30 PM, and after getting out of the Palais Garnier and going to 
the station in a rush, we scrambled to find and board the train to Versailles.
Surprisingly it wasn't very crowded, and we made it in time.

Upon reaching the train station at Versailles, the palace itself isn't very far.
It's about a 10-minute walk. Going in was seamless, although the crowds are 
quite thick. What followed was a walkthrough of the palace which was completed
in around half an hour. People were also shuffling forward at a decently fast
pace, not stopping for too long to examine the art, but I did manage to get some 
pictures of the ceilings.

![mural](/articles/2023/res/versailles_ceiling.jpg)
*Mural on the ceiling*

The hall of mirrors was probably the only thing I really remember. Not only 
because of the historical significance of the room, but also because the 
mirrors seemed slightly oxidized and not too bright.

![mirrors](/articles/2023/res/mirrors.jpg)
*Can confirm, the hall of mirrors does have mirrors*

We soon got out, and wanted to see the Gardens of Versailles. First of all, the
ticket to the palace does not give you entry to the gardens: those need a 
separate €10 ticket. Secondly, we came out around 5:05 PM, and when we got in 
the queue, the attendant repeately told us that the gardens close at 5:30, and 
that taking the ticket was not worth it. Quite a few people left the queue at 
that point, but we stuck around because we weren't going to come back.

Was it worth it?

![gardens](/articles/2023/res/gardens.jpg)

Hell yes. We speedran the gardens, which were probably more impressive than the
palace itself. They're absolutely enormous, occupying about twice or thrice the 
area of the palace (if you couldn't make out from the picture above). They're
also immaculately maintained. There was also a fountain show, but it ended soon 
after we reached. After taking some more pictures, we left for the station, 
making it out of the gardens on time. A short dinner at the KFC near the station 
followed, after which we took the train back to Paris.

### Pah-ree at night

We soon got off the train at Paris and had to take a metro with a 
switch-over to reach our hotel. Paris has the worst metro system of any city I
have been to. It's a bunch of matchboxes on tyres (yes, rubber tyres) hurtling
at insane speeds through metre-wide tracks strewn across the city like a kitty
that clawed through it's ball of yarn. You can't even go from one matchbox to
the other, because the carriages are not connected internally. Buses and trams
were also closed when we were in the city because of the riots, and the entire
populace decided to use the metro on Saturday Night. It was breathtaking, as in
my breath was literally taken away after being squeezed among people. Peak
Delhi Metro rush has got nothing on this.

We finally made it to the Eiffel Tower in one piece. There was a woman who had
married the Eiffel Tower<sup><a href='#footnote-3'>3</a></sup>, and it's easy
to see why. It's truly a thing of beauty, especially at night when it's lit up.
It lights up slowly at sunset, going from a dull red to a bright yellow, almost
as if the cast iron beams were put in an induction furnace. And if it couldn't
get any better, It bursts into sparkles at 11 PM in the night,

The Eiffel tower viewing was followed by Crepes at a store nearby: The crepe
maker took his time with the crepes, pouring the dough only when they were 
ordered and never making them en masse. He used a thin squeegee, the kind used 
to wash windows to make them. While the crepes were amazing, I still think my 
mother makes better and flatter _dosas_ with her _ultana_ than the crepe maker
made with his sophisticated tooling :)

The following day, we had to set off to the airport for our flight to Napoli. 
Breakfast at the hotel was just 3 euros, but it was the best croissant I've 
eaten in my life. It was super soft, and the pastry was not flaky at all. It was 
also very hollow on the inside, so you could tear it in half and stuff it with 
butter and jam. It's a shame I realized on the last day just how good Parisian
Croissants are, and I would've loved to try out a _boulangerie_ if I had more 
time<sup><a href='#footnote-4'>4</a></sup>.

### To Paris, with Love

I did notice a few things while in Paris: The person from whom we brought the 
Eiffel tower souvenir was Black, the person whose cart we approached first 
to grab a crepe was Turkish, and the person serving breakfast at our hotel was
Indian. This makes Paris seem like a very diverse city, but when you notice
that every single person selling Eiffel tower souvenirs was black and every
single cart-owner was Turkish, things look a bit darker (no pun intended). It's 
the sort of thing that won't strike you, until you have friends and family tell 
you that Paris was being rocked by the most violent riots since 2005, after 
a policeman shot dead a boy of color for a traffic offence. Then, the invisible
walls between people become all too clear, and the homogenity breaks down. I 
was fortunately unaffected by the riots, but I pray that things change for the 
better as soon as possible, and that the people of the city of love learn 
to love each other for who they are rather than how they look.

## Pasta

![pasta](/articles/2023/res/pasta.jpg)

Soon after Paris, we flew down to Napoli. We had booked a room here for three
nights, and I was looking forward to warmer climates and more beaches.

### Napoli

The area around Napoli Centrale is very well-maintained. It's only when you
walk down a few steps do you come to the suburbs, and find the dumpsters piled 
full of trash, plaster peeling off buildings and both the police and the army 
stationed opposite the bus stop across the street. Yikes.

Napoli reminded me of North Delhi. Kind people, not-so-great infra, and
crossing roads by waving your hand in front of cars (A skill I've mastered). 
There's a little spark of life behind every street corner: the children playing,
the old men and women sitting at the cafe, the wives drying clothes on the 
small balconies. It almost felt like I was transported back.

Public transportation in Napoli is a mess, the steets are wide, car-centric and
prone to traffic jams, so we walked 2.5 kilometers to get to the bay. We then
dropped down to a pizza joint nearby to grab some Pizza, and this was the best
pizza I've ever eaten, no question. It felt homely, lively, not overloaded with
cheese or toppings and with just enough crunch on the base. I finished that
pizza entirely, having skipped lunch.

### Pompeii

The plan for the next day was to head to Pompeii in the morning, and the beach
in the afternoon. We took the train to Pompeii from Napoli, and after a short 
walk reached the ruins. Do book your tickets in advance, as there are a lot of 
tour guides asking for high prices. And don't buy any hats or trinkets; they're 
very overpriced. 

![Pompeii](/articles/2023/res/pompeii_bath.jpg)
*Pompeii. I guess people... bathed here?*

Walking through the ruins reminded me of Ozymandias: Here stood a nation, once 
the ruler of most of Europe, and all that remains around are ruins. Ruins that
were buried as a consequence of the wrath of nature, not even ruins that fell
into ruin via conquest. Sure, I guess people bathed here and slept there 2000 
years ago, but there was no sense of grandeur looking at them. Or maybe I'm 
not an archaeology / history buff. There were very pretty flowers at a few spots
though, and there was a lovely courtyard garden in one of the uptown villas.
Roman homies had amazing cribs.

![pano](/articles/2023/res/roman_crib.jpg)
*One of the cleaner panos, if you can ignore my finger*

### Meta

After Pompeii, the plan was to hop down to Sorrento and take the bus that 
goes along the Amalfi coast, covering all the coastal towns. After getting on 
the train, Vedang said that if we got off at Meta, had lunch and then took 
the bus from Meta itself to Positano rather than going all the way to Sorrento,
we'd be good.

So we got off at Meta, and started looking for a place to eat. Google Maps led 
us to a supermarket, and we wanted to eat at a proper place. The only issue 
is that in a small sleepy hill-town, most of the places are not open for lunch.
Walking along, we came across a futsal-bar which had a bunch of kids inside,
probably celebrating someone's birthday.

> _Us:_ Are you open for Lunch?<br>
> _Person:_ I don't think so<br>
> <br>
> _awkward silence_<br>
> <br>
> _Person:_ Hold on I'll call the owner
> <br>
> _more waiting in awkward silence_<br>
> <br>
> _Grandpa:_ O come-a in! come-a in!

We were ushered in by Grandpa (who probably owned the place) and asked to make 
ourselves comfortable. He informed us that they only had pasta for lunch, as the 
oven was off. Soon, Granddaughter (I assume) came to take our orders, and we 
ordered two pastas. We were given some bread and breadsticks to start, and soon 
the drinks (two coca-colas) arrived too, so we weren't left hungry for long.
They even offered to let us take the bread on the way!

What followed though was the best pasta I've eaten in my life. Undoubtedly.
Perfectly cooked and perfectly seasoned. In the middle of a small town, when
they're supposed to be closed, they invited us in and served lunch. I come from
a land that believes in _Athithi Devo Bhava_, but even our restaurants wouldn't
go this far. Truly amazing, and if you do visit Meta ever, check out 
[Covent Garden Pub](https://www.coventgardenpub.net/). 

### Sorrento

After paying for the meal and taking the train down to Sorrento, we finally 
arrived around 2 PM. We then had two options: visit Bagni Regina Giovanna 
(The secret bathing place of Queen Joanna I of Naples, basically a natural
cove) which would take up to three hours, or we wait an hour for the bus that
takes us to Positano. The bus that would take us up to Regina Giovanna would
also take 45 minutes, so we decided to walk.

And so we set off uphill. The views were breathtaking and many a photo was taken,
but after walking uphill for 1.5 km, we were drenched in sweat. The walk after 
that point went something like this

> _Vedang:_ 👍<br>
> _Me:_ 🚶<br>
> _Vedang:_ 👍👍<br>
> _Me:_ 🚶<br>
> _Vedang:_ 👍👍👍<br>
> _Me:_ What are you doing<br>
> _Vedang:_ Asking for a lift<br>
> _Me:_ lmao do you think someone will give us a lift here? It's all tourist
> buses and cars<br>
> _Vedang:_ Yeah if I get one you can walk *chuckles*<br>
> _Me:_ *chuckles*<br>
> <br>
> _Us:_ 🚶🚶<br>
> <br>
> _A car pulls up_<br>
> _Stranger:_ Do you want a lift?<br>
> _Us:_ :o :o

Long story short: Someone gave us a lift to Bagni Regina Giovanna. Goodwill,
unlike lightning, struck the same spot twice in the span of 24 hours. I have no
words to describe what happened after. A twisting series of steps led to a
beach which truly took my breath away. I'll let the pictures do the talking.

![rg1](/articles/2023/res/regina_giovanna_adjacent.jpg)

![rg2](/articles/2023/res/regina_giovanna_cove.jpg)

![rg3](/articles/2023/res/regina_giovanna_outside.jpg)

### Positano

> Positano bites deep. It is a dream place that isn't quite real when you are 
> there and becomes beckoningly real after you have gone.
>
> _~ John Steinbeck_

After getting out of Bagni Regina Giovanna at around 4, we had two options: 
Go to Positano, or go back to Naples. Going to Positano was what we wanted 
to do, but the bus and train schedules were not in our favour. Dejected, we 
went to a shop near the beach and got some energy drinks to rehydrate.

Until a bus dropped by, and we hurriedly rushed on to it. The bus took us back 
down to the station, and we had reached just in time to make the bus to 
Positano. The only issue was that there were 5 buses all around. Walking around
and asking the bus drivers which one went to Positano, one of them said 
'This one'. We hurriedly hopped on, and this dream place suddenly became all 
too real.

![positano_towns](/articles/2023/res/positano_towns.jpg)

There are no roads in Positano. It is a mishmash of small buildings tied 
together by steps, cobbled paths and the millions of dollars of the super-rich 
who come to vacation here. We did see a superyacht or two around the bay, and 
a huge number of people. Very few backpackers. It seems like the vacation spot 
of choice for those who own a private yacht, or those who are in their 
mid-thirties and are going on a moderately affluent vacation. Places to live 
are quite expensive, as is food. In spite of the prices, the beach here is as 
crowded as it gets. Surprising.

The scarcity and remoteness does ensure one thing: The water in Positano is
clear blue. Clear, like freshly-made crystal glass. I would provide a hex code
being a programmer, but no hex code can come close to expressing how blue the
water really is. It's something you'd have to see for yourself. Hopefully some
of these pictures capture it.

After frolicking on the beach, we had to get back. Taking the bus would mean 
that we would have to wait for thirty minutes, and also climb all the way back 
up the hill. Instead, we took the ferry. And that completes the gauntlet of 
<strike>infinity stones</strike> means of travel, all in the span of a week: 
car, bus, train, boat, plane. The ferry ride was well worth it, even though we 
reached Sorrento by around 7:30 PM and had to take the train that was a bit 
late. The seas were as blue as the water on the beach, and with the wind 
running through your hair and the sun shining on your face, there is little else
that can make you as relaxed and happy as a ferry ride.

### Roma

![Rome](/articles/2023/res/rome.jpg)
*Sistine Chapel, as seen from Castel Sant'Angelo*

The next day was to be spent in Rome, with plans of seeing the Vatican and 
other things nearby. We travelled down to Rome quite early with one of the
Italo high-speed trains, zipping through the Roman countryside at 300 km/h.

![countryside](/articles/2023/res/countryside.jpg)
*Roman countryside*

The first thing we did was have breakfast at Roma Termini, and regroup with a 
friend who was at Rome. We then took the metro down to Vatican. After
bargaining with a tour guide for only skip-the-queue entry tickets to the
museum and sistine chapel (the ones on the website were all sold out), we
finally got some for a decent price with a student discount. The tickets were
for 1:30, and we had to regroup at their office for entry.

After that, St. Peter's square was a short hop away. It's much bigger than what
_Angels and Demons_ would lead you to believe, and it took a long time to 
circumnavigate the entire square. The catacombs are adjacent to the square and 
after asking two very serious swiss guards about them, we were told it was 
invite-only. 

Soon after making some more plans, we hopped out of the Vatican, and decided to 
walk down to Castel Sant'Angelo. There was a Gelato store near the Vatican, and
for €3 we got the most gigantic two scoops of Gelato I've ever had. It was so
comically big that the cone almost disappeared under it, and I had to
constantly lick the edges to keep the melting Gelato from dripping down.
Mmmmmmmm.

Castel Sant'Angelo was a proper Renaissance castle, originally made as a tomb 
for Emperor Hadrian. Also made famous by Angels and Demons, and the path to 
Illumination. The castle itself was okay, but the real takeaways were the memories
we made with our friends roaming the place :) It had an observation deck from
where you could see most of Rome, and also get very good views of the Sistine
Chapel (see the title picture)

After Castel Sant'Angelo, we went for Lunch. I don't know if we ate in the 
Vatican or in Rome, but we were stuck with a huge tax overhead and a very large
bill, so we probably ate in the Vatican. Also, word of advice from a friend: an
_Aperol Spritz_ sucks. It looks and tastes like cough syrup.

**EDIT**: There are no restaurants in the Vatican, so we did eat in Rome.

![sistine chapel](/articles/2023/res/sistine_chapel_streets.jpg)

I don't have many pictures of the inside of the Vatican Museum, but what I saw
truly moved me. Every single surface was either gilded, marbled or intricately
painted. Marble statues from thousands of years ago were strewn across the entire
museum like pots and plates in a kitchen. It was not the detail in the art there 
that took my breath away (It was the most detailed, intricate art I've seen), 
but rather the sheer magnitude of art. Room after room, Chamber after Chamber 
filled with priceless artifacts and wall-to-wall frescoes and paintings. It is 
said that the Holy See was the most powerful entity in the middle ages, and 
I wouldn't doubt it. No wonder the western world fought crusades for Jerusalem
and conquered more than half of the planet. If the sheer opulence and the
magnitude of wealth here wouldn't convince Christians that their religion is
better than others, it would definetly convince a heathen that the Christian
god is wealthier than their god.

*Battle of the Milvian Bridge*

![ceiling](/articles/2023/res/ceiling.jpg)
*If you told me this was Gold, I'd believe you*

I doubt the tacky paragraph and pictures above capture the essence of the
Vatican. It's something that has to be seen to be believed. Each of the
ceilings would have taken atleast a thousand man-hours to construct, and after
a point my neck would hurt from continuously staring up. There was so much
sensory overload that even the extraordinary became commonplace. So much that I
stopped taking pictures after the first few frescoes, and just shuffled through
the halls, agape at the scenes surrounding me. Versailles looked like a summer
fair in comparision to the Vatican Museum.

Finally, after going through the myriad chambers and ensemble of museums, we
made it to the Sistine Chapel. No photography was allowed, but everyone knows
what The Agony and The Ecstasy looks like. My only misconception was that I 
thought it would fill up the entire ceiling. Not so. It was this tiny painting
right in the centre amidst this huge ceiling filled with other paintings, so 
it was a bit underwhelming to see. Religious significance aside, The chapel
felt a bit overhyped to me, mostly because of the poor lighting and the huge
throng inside. I think some of the museums were more ornate and more intricate 
than the Chapel, but I may be wrong.

After this whirlwind experience, we were back where we started. There wasn't 
enough time to visit another place, so we decided to take a bus to a park 
that was near Termini. We ambled in the park for around half an hour, wondering
about where life was to take us after the internship and what awaited us when 
we returned back to College for our final year. The time passed quicker than I 
wanted it to, and in the blink of an eye, we were seated in the train back to
Napoli.

### Warm weather, warmer people

Just like that, the vacation was over, and we had our flight scheduled to
Netherlands the following day. The stay was quite comfortable: our BnB had an 
amazing shower, was very well-stocked with neccessities and nothing really felt
lacking. It's the spark of life that sets Italy apart: people care. Even if
they don't, people exist. The occasional broken turnstile was replaced by a
Guard, the checkout at the cornerstore was operated by a Granny, the shops are
run by people who see tourists daily and speak English, and an attendant would
help you if you couldn't book tickets at the kiosk. There is just enough chaos
to make life interesting, but not uncomfortable. Again, I've not stayed there
at length so this may be the idealistic tourist in me speaking, but I would if
given the chance.

Since we had an early flight, we packed up, left the keys to the room on the 
table and went out to the airport. Only to be greeted with a [red alert warning for the Netherlands](https://www.reuters.com/business/environment/storm-disrupts-air-train-traffic-netherlands-2023-07-05/)
because of Storm Poly.

I'd like to dock points from Napoli Airport here: our flight timings came and 
went, without any information about what was happening to our flight. The flight
crew came to the gate, and then were told that the flight was delayed. Resigned
to the fate of nature, they sat some distance from us and ordered their lunch.
It was both hilarious and sad to see. Fortunately, looking at the Schiphol app,
all the AirFrance-KLM flights were postponed to after 5 PM, and all other flights 
(including EasyJet and other budget carries) were cancelled. Guess which airplane
a backpacking college student was flying on?

KLM. Not EasyJet.

Thank god. I bought the expensive ticket on the advice of Vedang (after his 
EasyJet out of Geneva was cancelled), and I have never been happier to buy a
more expensive ticket than I was once we touched down at Schiphol safe and
sound, as my flight back to India was scheduled just the following day.

All was still not well, as we were made to stand in queues for multiple hours 
and once we boarded the flight, we sat on the runway for a good forty-five 
minutes before going airborne. Missed out on a proper lunch, and had to make do 
with the snacks onboard the flight.

## The Last Supper

After landing in the Netherlands and hauling my luggage down to the room (which 
was tiny), my roomie went to Centraal. I had decided that I'd stuff myself full
after the long morning and skipping lunch. There weren't many good options to
eat living near the airport, but there was a Correndon hotel down the road from
where I put up near Schiphol, with very decent reviews on Google, and a quoted
price of €10-€20. I decided to walk down in my jeans and black hoodie. This
place had a 747 before the entrance, and after giving it a good look I swaggered
through the revolving doors, super hungry. 

> _Me:_ Hi, I'd like a table for one<br>
> _Desk:_ Sure, would you like me to bill it to your room<br>
> _Me, living in the Ibis down the road:_ No, I'd pay by card<br>
> _Desk:_ Okay, that would come to €33.98<br>
> <br>
> _Me, in my mind:_ OMGWTFML can't back down now<br>
> <br>
> _Me:_ _Gulps_ Sure, here you go

And just like that, I spent >60% of what I spent to live for a night here, on
food. Surrounded by all these old, fancy business execs whose companies were
paying for their food and lodging, and me in my hoodie and jeans :P You're only
young and dumb once, I guess.

But hey, atleast the food was good. And it was an all-you-can-eat. I'd like to 
say no regrets, but that was the most money I've ever spent for a single meal
on myself.

## Chicken Curry

My flight back was uneventful, but the drive from Mumbai to Pune in the lashing
rain at 3 AM in the night was something to remember. The comforts of home are
so numerous so as to be unenumerable, and I enjoyed the two and a half weeks at
home doing absolutely nothing but waking up late and having good food. Oh, and
trekking to Visapur fort with my friends!

## Conclusion

That's been it. I know this is not the latest edition of Conde Nast Traveller,
so I'll refrain from writing a cheesy editor's note, but I'm quite pleased with
how this article turned out. This is one of, if not the biggest article I've 
written (6000+ words!). After reconsidering fleshing out the different sections multiple
times, I'm glad I took the effort to finally do so. However, this will be my 
first and last travelogue, because it takes a disproportionate amount of effort
to both recollect and document every single minutiae of your trip
[Sam Kapasi style](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/travelogues/87398-yetiblog-weddings-drivings-france-germany-italy-croatia-slovenia-2.html),
and I don't want to do this while on the trip.

Touring the world while young is a good way to break your assumptions, curb
your impulsivity and increase your tolerance. And travelling doesn't imply
zipping around town in an air-conditioned bus, stopping at only the tourist
attractions. Travelling implies using the public transport, drinking water from
the public fountains and finding your own path amongst the crowds thronging the
streets. If you do this, you'll soon realize that the world around is not as
everyone's Instagram stories tell you: there's a lot more to it than pretty
lights and beautiful sights. 

Bon Voyage!
