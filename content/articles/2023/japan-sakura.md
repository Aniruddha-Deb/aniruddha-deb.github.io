## Introduction

Sometime when I was interning at Optiver, an innocent-looking email dropped into 
my Inbox

![Japan email](/articles/2023/res/japan_email.png)

It's premise was simple: _form bharo aur jeeto Japan jaane ka mauka!_ (Fill 
this form and win a trip to Japan!)

Not thinking much, I filled it in. It took about 10 minutes to do so. IITD 
being IITD, I knew my chances were slim, because they would inevitably CG sort 
the candidates and my CG was far from spectacular.

Life carried on as usual. Until I got a call from my dad one day when at work 

> "Deba, you're going to Japan?"<br>
> "I don't know, am I?"<br>
> "This lady from your university called me because she couldn't reach your 
>  number. Can you email her your details?"<br>
> "Oh yeah, sure. Sure thing."

And just like that, I won the _Japan jaane ka mauka_ ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ

## Night flight to Japan

Once the auspices of a Visa and other preparations were done, our flight was
scheduled on the evening of 23rd September, around 7 PM. Before leaving, we met
at ex hall to get to know each other, and to book seats on the flight together.
With the pleasantries out of the way, our _paltan_ booked out row 55 of the 
flight, and decided to meet near Jwala Circle at 3 PM tomorrow.

The 23rd finally rolled around, and four of us made our way to the airport from 
campus. Checking in, emigration and security checks were all smooth, and there 
was relatively little rush on a Saturday afternoon. After that, we met up with 
the DU contingent, whom we had also met while receiving our visas at the 
embassy. While waiting around the departure gate, there seemed to be a 
surprisingly large number of college students. I thought most of them would be 
studying in Japan, and some would be our compatriots from the IITs in North 
India. Didn't think much of this, and soon it was time to board.

After boarding, the flight attendants started to make their way through the 
cabin, marking out the seats where an asian vegetarian meal would be served
with a green AVML sticker. This included my seat. Seemed very meticulous. Very 
precise. Very _Japanese_.

It must be mentioned that at this time, I was working on a paper for ICLR whose 
deadline was on the 28th. After submitting the abstract, some flaws were popping
up in a method that I had proposed, and the hour I spent waiting for the flight 
was spent fixing some part of this. I thought that I would make more progress,
but it's hard to develop without internet access, and JAL's internet access is 
completely paid. No free tier. Oof.

Dinner took some of this off my mind. It was nothing spectacular: Paneer
curry with some rice, fruits, boiled corn, dahi bhalla and a scone. I have no
idea why every economy in-flight meal serves this scone. It was there even when
I flew KLM. Although that was breakfast, and they also served a slice of cheese
with it. There was literally nothing I could pair the scone with. I finally
resorted to having it with butter and some paneer curry. Not great, but it'll 
pass.

Soon, it was time to doze off. Once I woke up, I ate the second meal they had
given me, which was some fruit and a cupcake. We had an hour to land, and they 
started to distribute immigration forms. Japan requires you to fill these
immigration forms. In Japanese fashion, they're very _kawaii_ and seem like
postcards rather than serious government documents. They're also fastidiously
precise, with every field being in a box. 

![Japanese immigration form]()

I wonder what will happen to the Japanese Bureaucracy once _Maikurosoftu
Exceru_ is deprecated. Or if _Officeu sree-shixty-fiveu_ is discontinued. Maybe
budding _mangakas_ would be hired to draw pixel-perfect government forms? One
can wonder...

The reassuring _thud_ of land soon came by. One of Tokyo Haneda's runways is
built on land reclaimed from the sea. Unfortunately, we did not land on this
runway. Maybe it was for the best, as things built on the ocean have a lower 
shelf life than their inland counterparts

On disembarking, the rays of the rising sun caressed our faces. Three months
after winning the _Japan Jaane ka Mauka_, it was finally time to say

## Ohayo Nihon! (24 Sep)

It was around 6:30 AM Japan time when we landed. Haneda is no different from 
any large airport, and the walk from the skybridge to the terminal was a long 
and awe-filled one. 

Until I got to a restroom.

No, it wasn't the japanese toilet, that comes later. Japanese urinals don't have 
dividers between them.

![no dividers]()

It's said that when you're a kid, peeing and pooping are funny. When you're an
adolescent, sex jokes are funny. When you're an adult, your sense of humour
is murdered by the seriousness of the world and is not reborn until you retire.
Anyway, my sense of humor aged from 0 to 60 while using those urinals. I will 
leave out the details, because some are not safe for work. 

After wrapping that up, we had to get through immigration. The Japanese love
for QR codes beats their love for Microsoft Excel, because there are QR codes 
_everywhere_. There's one for getting through immigration (You can fill their 
online form and get a QR code), theres' one on the immigration sticker they 
put on your passport, and there's one to get through customs (Again, If you 
filled their online form).
