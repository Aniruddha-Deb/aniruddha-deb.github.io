## Introduction

Sometime when I was interning at Optiver, an innocent-looking email dropped into 
my Inbox

![Japan email](/articles/2023/res/japan_email.png)

It's premise was simple: _form bharo aur jeeto Japan jaane ka mauka!_ (Fill 
this form and win a trip to Japan!)

Not thinking much, I filled it in. It took about 10 minutes to do so. IITD 
being IITD, I knew my chances were slim, because they would inevitably CG sort 
the candidates and my CG was far from spectacular.

Life carried on as usual. Until I got a call from my dad one day when at work 

> "Deba, you're going to Japan?"<br>
> "I don't know, am I?"<br>
> "This lady from your university called me because she couldn't reach your 
>  number. Can you email her your details?"<br>
> "Oh yeah, sure. Sure thing."

And just like that, I won the _Japan jaane ka mauka_ ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ

## Night flight to Japan

Once the auspices of a Visa and other preparations were done, our flight was
scheduled on the evening of 23rd September, around 7 PM. Before leaving, we met
at ex hall to get to know each other, and to book seats on the flight together.
With the pleasantries out of the way, our _paltan_ booked out row 55 of the 
flight, and decided to meet near Jwala Circle at 3 PM tomorrow.

The 23rd finally rolled around, and four of us made our way to the airport from 
campus. Checking in, emigration and security checks were all smooth, and there 
was relatively little rush on a Saturday afternoon. After that, we met up with 
the DU contingent, whom we had also met while receiving our visas at the 
embassy. While waiting around the departure gate, there seemed to be a 
surprisingly large number of college students. I thought most of them would be 
studying in Japan, and some would be our compatriots from the IITs in North 
India. Didn't think much of this, and soon it was time to board.

After boarding, the flight attendants started to make their way through the 
cabin, marking out the seats where an asian vegetarian meal would be served
with a green AVML sticker. This included my seat. Seemed very meticulous. Very 
precise. Very _Japanese_.

It must be mentioned that at this time, I was working on a paper for ICLR whose 
deadline was on the 28th. After submitting the abstract, some flaws were popping
up in a method that I had proposed, and the hour I spent waiting for the flight 
was spent fixing some part of this. I thought that I would make more progress,
but it's hard to develop without internet access, and JAL's internet access has
no free tier. Oof.

Dinner took some of this off my mind. It was nothing spectacular: Paneer
curry with some rice, fruits, boiled corn, dahi bhalla and a scone. I have no
idea why every economy in-flight meal serves this scone. It was there even when
I flew KLM. Although that was breakfast, and they also served a slice of cheese
with it. There was literally nothing I could pair the scone with. I finally
resorted to having it with butter and some paneer curry. Not great, but it'll 
pass.

Soon, it was time to doze off. Once I woke up, I ate the second meal they had
given me, which was some fruit and a cupcake. We had an hour to land, and they 
started to distribute immigration forms. Japan requires you to fill these
immigration forms. In Japanese fashion, they're very _kawaii_ and seem like
postcards rather than serious government documents. They're also fastidiously
precise, with every field being in a box. 

![Japanese immigration form]()

I wonder what will happen to the Japanese Bureaucracy once _Maikurosoftu
Exceru_ is deprecated. Maybe budding _mangakas_ would be hired to draw
pixel-perfect government forms? One can wonder...

The reassuring _thud_ of land soon came by. One of Tokyo Haneda's runways is
built on land reclaimed from the sea. Unfortunately, we did not land on this
runway. Maybe it was for the best, as things built on the ocean have a lower 
shelf life than their inland counterparts

On disembarking, the rays of the rising sun caressed our faces. Three months
after winning the _Japan Jaane ka Mauka_, it was finally time to say

## Ohayo Nihon! (24 Sep)

It was around 6:30 AM Japan time when we landed. Haneda is no different from 
any large airport, and the walk from the skybridge to the terminal was a long 
and awe-filled one. 

After grabbing our bags, we had to get through immigration. The Japanese love
for QR codes beats their love for Microsoft Excel, because there are QR codes 
_everywhere_. There's one for getting through immigration (You can fill their 
online form and get a QR code), theres' one on the immigration sticker they 
put on your passport, and there's one to get through customs (Again, If you 
filled their online form). Unfortunately, the customs one requires a digital 
passport, and we didn't have one, so it was time to get into another queue.

Once we got through, people from all the invited universities started to
trickle in. Apparently, _all_ universities had to board the flight from Delhi 
to get to Japan, and getting to Delhi was their headache. It was fortunate then,
that our visa was hassle-free at the embassy, and all we had to do was take a 
cab to IGI. Delhi for the win!

We got handed breakfast, and soon piled into a bus, led by our coordinator. Once 
we were all in the bus, She introduced herself as Kumiko Aizawa, and we were to 
call her _Kumiko-san_. That's interesting, because Rahul told me that the 
Japanese preferred to be called by their last names. I'm sure that's true 
though, so don't take this experience at face value.

The drive out from Haneda was amazing. We got on these japanese highways, and
the signboards were in both English and Japanese. Reminded me of _Wangan
Midnight_. A post-hoc analysis reveals we took the Shuto Expressway into the
city, and probably covered part of the Bayshore route. _Omoshiroi_!

The first stop on our journey was Asakusa, and the Sensoji Temple. Standard 
homecoming fare: Take the blessings of god before embarking on your journey, 
and it shall go well. The Japanese are superstitious, but I'm some-stitious.
Nevertheless, some of their stitions rubbed off on me. I hope the lucky incense 
helped (I'll need the luck for PhD admissions :P)

![asakusa avenue](/articles/2023/res/japan/sensoji_temple.jpg)

Soon after, we hopped down to Tokyo Skytree. This is the latest and tallest 
observation deck in Tokyo, and is the tallest freestanding structure there (
640 metres, iirc). I've been to Euromast previously, and that was hardly half 
the height of this monstrosity. You'd sprain your neck looking up at the top.

![skytree lobby](/articles/2023/res/japan/skytree_lobby.jpg)

Fortunately you don't need to look up for a long time, as the superfast lifts 
will take you up in less than a minute! Each lift has a theme, and we took the 
spring one while going up and the winter one while coming down. The acceleration 
is quite gradual, so the only indication you're moving very fast is the 
pressure change, and you can feel your ears pop as you get higher.

![skytree 2](/articles/2023/res/japan/winter.jpg)
![skytree 2](/articles/2023/res/japan/spring.jpg)

Once upstairs, you could see all of Tokyo. There wasn't much to see, other than 
a metric ton of buildings. A concrete forest, laced with the occasional shining 
stream of water. You could make out Mt. Fuji in the distance, rising amidst 
the fog.

![view from skytree, with fuji in the distance](/articles/2023/res/japan/skytree_fuji.jpg)
![skytree 2](/articles/2023/res/japan/skytree_2.jpg)

After taking a quick round, we had more time to kill, so we ran down to the 
transparent floor area and took some pictures. We returned back to the meeting 
point, only to be taken back to the transparent floor again :) very nice.

After this was time for lunch. We went to an Indian restaurant, which almost 
all of us had booked out (or I thought so, as I didn't see any others there).
The vegetarians and non-vegetarians were separated, and I had _palak chicken_ 
with Dal, Naan and Sticky Rice. While the food was decent, there's more about 
it later.

![skytree 2](/articles/2023/res/japan/random_shot.jpg)

The next stop was the JST office, located at the Science Plaza. The area seemed 
expensive: A Bentley Bentayga and Rolls Royce were casually parked around. I 
don't think government officials are paid very much more, so the surrounding 
neighbourhood probably became more expensive, and the building stayed where it 
was. Once in, we were shuttled off to the basement. With thirty minutes left 
before we started (The japanese are super-punctual), I went to the washroom.
And there I had my first tryst with the Japanese Toilets.

![](image)

Japanese toilets themselves are like any other. The only difference is the
_Washlet_, which is a smart toilet seat made by Toto. It's got umpteen bells
and whistles, and an even larger number of buttons to ring these bells. I think
the complexity is a bit overrated though, because I was able to use it without
knowing how to read Japanese.

After the meeting, the last stop was our hotel. We were living at the
Metropolitan Edmont, in Iidabashi. We were allotted three a room, but with only
one card to start out with. It was okay in a pinch, as we had to stick around
for a week at most. Housing in Tokyo is also quite expensive, so JST probably
had a limit on how much they could spend on housing. Which is fair. The rooms,
however, were great. Decently large and quite inviting, with a view out
over the highway. The Japanese equivalent of _Atithi Devo Bhava_ is
_Omotenashi_, meaning to wholeheartedly look after guests. I think they had
this down to a T so far.

After settling in, I took a quick shower, had some green tea and chatted with 
my roommates. We then dropped down for dinner at another Indian place close by.
Surprisingly, the dinner was almost exactly the same: Naan, rice, dal, chicken 
and a _Onion Bhajji_. While _Omotenashi_ is great, it dawned on us that we 
would be eating Indian food every lunch and dinner. And I was already tired of 
eating _Naan_.

![dinner](/articles/2023/res/japan/dinner.jpg)

Chatting around the dinner table, we quickly hashed out a plan of visiting
Shibuya, jetlag be damned. We decided to convene downstairs at 7:30 PM, and 
take the metro to Shibuya.

In addition to the elaborate lists of things people had to get from 
Japan for themselves, because they had seen it on YouTube, or in an anime
or manga, they had also taken up the duty of becoming delivery boys (and girls)
for their friends and family. An International BlinkIt/Instamart, if you
may. Our _paltan_ was no different. Heck, _I_ was no different. However, I had 
an ace up my sleeve that the other travellers didn't: _Clarity_. I had set 
foot on this island with one and only one shopping goal - To get a good _mahjong_
set.

I'd love to take a twenty minute detour to explain what Mahjong is, but I digress.
We reached Shibuya in around 15-20 minutes, and the first thing we see on 
crawling out of the subway was the famed Shibuya Scramble.

It seemed like any other _chowk_ in Delhi, just more organized. Cars puttering 
around. People standing.

Until the lights turned red.

![scramble](/articles/2023/res/japan/shibuya_scramble.jpg)

You can't really see the crowd on the other end because the cars block them,
but once the pedestrian lights turn green, it's a tidal wave of people. It's 
like someone filled a glass halfway with people, and gave it a swirl. And the 
most surprising thing is that amidst all this chaos, everything goes back to 
normal once the lights turn green. The scramble stops scrambling, and becomes
another ordinary _chowk_.

After dashing around it like only tourists could, we decided on where to go 
next. Rajeev wanted to go to Onitsuka Tiger to get some shoes for his friends, 
and all of us followed. However, the store turned out to be an _Onitsuka_ store,
instead of an _Onitsuka Tiger_. 

What's the difference?

![onitsuka shibuya parco](/articles/2023/res/japan/onitsuka.jpg)

_Onitsuka_ is apparently a more formal spinoff substore of Onitsuka Tiger, which 
itself is a semi-formal spinoff of what is now ASICS. We had made the rookie
mistake of confusing JavaScript with Java, and turned back dejectedly.

Since nobody had any plans in particular, it was time for Mahjong. I looked on
Google for toy stores around me, and found this place called Mega Don Quijote,
which was a bargain store with a very high rating. Good choice of name. It was
also just a five-minute walk, so we set off for it. 

On reaching, we found that the store spanned seven floors, with toys somewhere 
on the fifth floor. Welp, atleast they had escalators. They also had cosmetics,
which Shriya wanted to have a look at. After a totally democratic vote<cite>, 
we decided to scour the shop from top to bottom.

On reaching the top, there was nothing of particular interest. Going one floor
lower, there was still nothing of interest. The third floor, however, was
supposed to have toys. On getting there, all of us scoured the area for anything 
resembling _Mahjong_. There was Pokemon, watches, and an adult section cordoned 
off with curtains.

And then there were Board Games. And then there was Mahjong.

The first set I picked was as long as a guitar. No way I was carrying that back 
in my bag. The next set was smaller, and blue. It also had a decent heft to it.
"AMOS SMART", read the cover. This is a game for smart people.

"There's one more over here" Atul said. This one was red, about the same size,
and weighed much more.

"AMOS MASTERS", read the cover. I'm definetly not a master. I hardly even know 
this game.

I then flipped both over to peep at the pricetags. The Smart set was probably 
6000 yen, while the Masters one was around 8000 yen. That's around 4.3k for
those at home.

Buying the cheaper set would have been the Smart decision. Guess which set I 
took back.

And so, Mission Mahjong was accomplished. The next stop was the cosmetics 
section, but 


With that out of the way, the next stop was the cosmetics section.
