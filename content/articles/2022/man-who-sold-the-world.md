> We passed upon the stair<br>
> We spoke of was and when<br>
> Although I wasn't there<br>
> He said I was his friend<br>
> Which came as a surprise<br>
> I spoke into his eyes<br>
> "I thought you died alone,<br>
> A long long time ago"<br>
> 
> "Oh no, not me<br>
> I never lost control<br>
> You're face to face<br>
> With the man who sold the world"<br>
> 
> I laughed and shook his hand<br>
> And made my way back home<br>
> I searched for form and land<br>
> For years and years I roamed<br>
> I gazed a gazeless stare<br>
> At all the millions here<br>
> I must have died alone<br>
> A long, long time ago<br>
> 
> Who knows? Not me<br>
> We never lost control<br>
> You're face to face<br>
> With the man who sold the world<br>

want to detract from the mystery and intrigue of them one bit by fleshing my 
story out. Simply beautiful.
