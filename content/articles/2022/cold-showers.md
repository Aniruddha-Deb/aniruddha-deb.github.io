Day 249 of taking a cold shower. It's something I've been doing since April, 
and although the temperature has fallen and the geyser in my bathroom has been
fixed come winter, it's a habit I want to keep. Nothing makes you feel as alive
as a cold shower does.

Speaking of durations, it's also been exactly a month since my last post. A lot 
has happened since, and I've been too wrapped up in the happenings to get time 
to post here once a week. This sem has been no different than others, with you 
progressively realizing the depth to which you've sunk in the quicksand only as
more classes happen and the majors draw near.

But I think I've gotten the hang of this. Not just the semester, but life in 
general, and rather than looking at what I can do here, I'm looking outward to 
upcoming goals in life. Ah, too much abstraction. TL;DR: With the endsems 
ending tomorrow, I expect to write more frequently here ;)
