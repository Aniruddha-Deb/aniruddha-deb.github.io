After a few days of reading and furious coding, I'm happy to announce the creation of [MLZoo](https://github.com/Aniruddha-Deb/MLZoo): a set of ML algorithms in their natural habitat

MLZoo is a set of jupyter notebooks which would contain implementations of several ML algorithms on real world datasets: so far, I've implemented different flavours of regression, and plan to add quite a few more algorithms over the summer.

Do star, fork and contribute in any way possible! 

(Hopefully this doesn't end up like MathNotes :fingers\_crossed:)

NOTE: MLZoo has temporarily been taken private. This is because it overlaps with a certain course that I'm doing, and just to be on the safe side, I'll make it public once this is over.
