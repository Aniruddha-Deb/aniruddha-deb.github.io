> In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole,

> sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a
> hobbit-hole, and that means comfort.

Intro

## An Unexpected Party

> Sorry! I don't want any adventures, thank you. Not Today. Good morning! But
> please come to tea - anytime you like! Why not tomorrow? Good bye! 

Covid times, DepC, learnings, etc. Staying at home.

## Queer Lodgings

> I'm going on an adventure!

Getting on campus. Fourth Semester Woes.

This is a good time to talk about clubs 

There's a semester that sort of shows you how bad things can get. A semester where 
you sort of 'grow up'. Fourth semester was that for me.

## Not At Home

> Then something Tookish woke up inside him, and he wished to go and see the
> great mountains, and hear the pine-trees and the waterfalls, and explore the
> caves, and wear a sword instead of a walking-stick.

## The Clouds Burst

> 'Where did you go to, if I may ask?' said Thorin to Gandalf as they rode along.<br>
> 'To look ahead,' said he.<br>
> 'And what brought you back in the nick of time?'<br>
> 'Looking behind,' said he.

This is a good time to talk about courses. By the end of second year, you would
have done some theory, some discrete math, some algorithms, some systems and
some compilers. In my case, I had also done some Machine Learning. You can now
start taking electives, because in all likelihood you would have done 75/80
credits by now. There are two approaches when it comes to taking electives:

1. Play it safe, and take electives that will boost your CG. This implies taking
   'safe' department electives with professors that give relatively less work 
   and grade lightly. Most people take these electives, so there's also safety  
   in numbers, and people to pad your grade in case you do poorly
2. Take the hardest electives

There are also two philosophies on how to take electives: most people keep off 
electives until the final year, as that would give them more time to build their 
skills and decide what to do with their life decide where their and also give
them more time to tackle the harder courses. The second philosophy is to jump
in to the pond of knowledge like a thirsty camel: take as many electives as you
can as early on, either to wrap up your degree early or to gain knowledge so
that you can do research in your final year. 

One recurring thread to emphasize is that there is no 'right' answer here. 
People have done both, and been successful. It all depends on what you want to 
do with your life, and this is also the time around which you should get some 
clarity about your path after college. If you have clarity in 

hand, one section of people would 
give them time to explore, and would also give them time 

There's absolutely nothing

## The Last Stage

Learnings

There are four skills you should try to pick up during your time here:

1. **Learning**: Being able to learn quickly. 
2. **Communicating**: Being able to pass on your ideas clearly and articluately 
   to others, being able to teach others, being able to speak and present your 
   ideas
3. **Problem Solving**: Being able to identify problems and coming up with
   solutions to them. This is mostly the 'intuition' part of the solution. Finding
   problems is equally important compared to coming up with solutions.
4. **Building**: Being able to implement solutions to problems and having
   people use those solutions. This is the implementation part of problem
   solving.

In the end, what I feel the lack of most strongly at IIT is choice. Most people
here are not independent thinkers. Maybe it is the fallacy of a conservative 
and overprotective society, but it's surprising how the brightest people in
India are asleep at the wheel of their vehicles. We have no experience in
independent decision making, having let our parents, family and teachers make
decisions for us ever since we were children. People don't take the path
that they know would truly make them content, but instead take the safest, most
optimal path on their decision boundary and then seek contentment in safety and
in the approval of society around them.

* If you're in CS, you must chase after quant
* If you're in any branch less than mechanical, you must chase after consult/management
* If your CG is low, you should take ASL/MSL/RDL to boost it up
* If you want to develop your personality, you should join a club.

I won't get on a high horse here, having been guilty of one or multiple of the
above. What I would like to encourage is clarity, most importantly about one's 
trajectory. The most successful people I know here are not those who are numero 
uno by the system's metrics, but those who are clear about their trajectory. 
They seek out opportunities outside these walls, while others try to chase 

Some FAQ's: Best courses to take here. I'd say take atleast one Reetika Khera 
course. Most of my advice is CS-biased,
