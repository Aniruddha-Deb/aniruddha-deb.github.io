I'm a Senior Undergraduate in the Computer Science and Engineering Department
at IIT Delhi, advised by Prof. Parag Singla and Prof. Mausam. I am also a
Reliance Foundation Scholar in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Sciences. I
was an SWE intern at Optiver last summer, and an Undergraduate Research
Assistant at the Neuroimaging Lab the summer before that.

Apart from this, I've been a volunteer teacher for NSS, an Academic Mentor for
MTL100, a runner-up in Mimamsa 2021, a journalist at Board for Student
Publications, a Representative for the Quizzing Club, and a Student Mentor for
Freshers.
