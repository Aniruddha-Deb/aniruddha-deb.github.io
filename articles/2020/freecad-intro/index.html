  <section><p>MCP100 is a course that all first year undergrads in IITD have to go through.
It consists of two parts: the first part is engineering drawing, using rulers
and pencils, and CAD. After a disastrous drawing minor, the next phase involved
getting to terms with CAD. The CAD package our course instructor decided on was
FreeCAD, and since the minor ended, I&rsquo;ve done nothing but create FreeCAD models.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a <em>pero</em><sup>1</sup> at it though, (there&rsquo;s still plenty to learn), and
once that is done, there are plenty of bugs to fix :P. I do think I&rsquo;ve got a
decently good footing in it, and I&rsquo;ll be sharing my experiences here.</p>
<h2 id="parametric-modelling">Parametric Modelling</h2>
<p>While the basic concepts of Drafting are pretty easy to pick up (parallel lines,
projections, isometric view etc), the concepts of 3D CAD are a bit different.
Most 3D CAD packages you&rsquo;ll encounter will belong to a family of softwares
called <strong>Parametric Modellers</strong>: Fusion 360, Inventor, SolidWorks, Siemens NX are
all parametric modellers. What &lsquo;Parametric&rsquo; means is that the geometry of your
part is determined by parameters, and changing the parameters changes the
geometry. Here&rsquo;s a small example:</p>
<p><img src="res/parametric_modelling.gif" alt="Parametric Modeling"></p>
<p>Notice how changing the parameters of the sketch change the values of the model
as well. As opposed to this <strong>Direct Modelling</strong> is a method of modelling which
is more like molding clay: once the hole is made, changing it&rsquo;s parameters are
trickier. This is used more in the art industry, and softwares such as Blender
Maya and 3DSMax are direct modellers.</p>
<p>Parametric modeling has it&rsquo;s benefits in manufacturing; it is very easy to
translate exact dimensions to the part when using this methodology as opposed
to direct modelling. One downside is that modelling curves and free-form surfaces
is notoriously difficult. There are many more articles on parametric vs direct
modelling on the internet <a href="https://www.ptc.com/en/blogs/cad/parametric-vs-direct-modeling-which-side-are-you-on">here</a>,
<a href="https://www.designworldonline.com/what-is-parametric-modeling/">here</a> and
<a href="https://www.engineering.com/DesignSoftware/DesignSoftwareArticles/ArticleID/16587/Whats-the-Difference-Between-Parametric-and-Direct-Modeling.aspx">here</a>,
so I won&rsquo;t go further in this article.</p>
<h2 id="freecad-3d-parametric-modelling-for-free">FreeCAD: 3D Parametric Modelling for Free</h2>
<p>Notice something common in all the aforementioned softwares? <em>Their prices</em>. All
of them, with the exception of Blender, cost over $1000 for a single license. The
ones that don&rsquo;t come with a license, generally tie you to their platform with
a notorious subscription-based model (Autodesk, I&rsquo;m looking at you). FreeCAD
in this manner is pretty good, but you get what you pay for. I was expecting it
to be like Blender<sup>2</sup>, but became pretty disappointed when I saw that it&rsquo;s pretty
buggy and not as fully featured as other packages.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a n00b to parametric modelling, having done it multiple times in Fusion
360 for several projects, so jumping into FreeCAD was relatively painless. Much
of the workflow is the same; create a sketch, extrude (they call it &lsquo;pad&rsquo; here),
create another sketch, push (they call it &lsquo;pocket&rsquo; here), rinse and repeat.</p>
<p>In a few hours time, I was done with the assignment that was uploaded.</p>
<p><img src="res/assignment.png" alt="Yes I know this was done by Sir, do you really think I&rsquo;ll post snaps of the others so that you can copy them? ;)"></p>
<p>Here are some observations I picked up while doing the assignment:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change the line drawing to 4xMSAA for smoother lines</li>
<li>Change navigation style to Blender (More intuitive for me, as I have prior
experience with Blender)</li>
<li>Change orbit style to &lsquo;Turntable&rsquo;. Trackball is a nightmare</li>
<li>Change to a dark theme <strong>If you&rsquo;re on Windows or Linux</strong>. Any theme is
horribly glitchy on Mac</li>
<li>Background color for the viewport can be changed in settings as well, if you&rsquo;re more used to AutoCAD/Blender dark backgrounds</li>
<li>The Cube is the best way to navigate; try to spend most of your time in
isometric views and front/side/back views. Panning/rotating is not too
smooth here compared to the other packages.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve zoomed in too much or too little, use the &lsquo;fit contents to viewport&rsquo;
button or just hit V and F</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="more-complex-models">More Complex models</h2>
<p>I then decided to do something a bit more complex: create and assemble an entire
product using FreeCAD. I have done this with Fusion 360 twice, and since FreeCAD
is not very different, it should handle this workload fine as well.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p><strong>There are so many features that other CAD packages have, which have no analogue
in FreeCAD, or a very half-baked implementation</strong>.</p>
<ol>
<li>You created a sketch with multiple faces in it and want to extrude only a
select few of those? Nope, sorry, can&rsquo;t do that</li>
<li>You created all your parts and want to assemble them? Nope, FreeCAD doesn&rsquo;t
ship with an assembly workbench. You need to install another assembly
workbench. By &lsquo;Other&rsquo;, there is only one assembly workbench for v18.x (A2Plus),
and Assembly3 and Assembly4 are for v19+ only.</li>
<li>Now you want to install this workbench? Well, good luck if you&rsquo;re on Mac, because
the addon manager seems to be broken. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like on the FreeCAD
wiki, and here&rsquo;s what it looks like on my machine</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="res/addonmgr.png" alt="On Windows"> <img src="res/addonmgr_mac.png" alt="On Mac"></p>
<p>So much for platform independence. I had to install the addon manually which,
thankfully, was painless enough. No proprietrary formats involved, just clone
the git repo into the <code>Mod</code> directory</p>
<p>Once the assembly was imported, using A2Plus, <strong>I had to manually import
all the parts in one file separately</strong>. A2Plus didn&rsquo;t pick them up automatically
and add the parts as different parts: if you open the file normally, it just
mushes all the parts up as one big &lsquo;blob&rsquo;, which is then inserted.</p>
<p>After some frustration, the Assembly was finally complete.</p>
<p><img src="res/assembly.png" alt="Assembly"></p>
<p>I now had to generate a top view and a cross-sectional view. The procedure for
this was pretty simple: go into TechDraw, insert a top view, then insert a
sectional view. This would be great and smooth, <strong>if only the section view
wasn&rsquo;t so glitchy</strong>. I couldn&rsquo;t find options to change hatching patterns for
individual parts, and the handle for the vice glitched out and wasn&rsquo;t shaded.
Instead, there were these two long, parallel lines that I couldn&rsquo;t delete.
<strong>And how do you scale views in TechDraw!?</strong> Everything I tried didn&rsquo;t work,
and finally I had to increase the paper size to fit the diagram in 1:1.
This was ok for a vice, but could you imagine designing your next aeroplane
in this software?</p>
<p><img src="res/A2.png" alt="1:1 Projection on an A2 sheet"></p>
<h2 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding remarks</h2>
<p>I do have mixed feelings for this software: on one side, it represents that
large softwares with multimillion dollar licenses can also have open-source
alternatives. On the other hand, it&rsquo;s bugginess, glitchiness and lack of
industry-grade features truly disappoint me. Of course, since it&rsquo;s open source,
sitting on the sidelines and pointing fingers won&rsquo;t help. The only way to
fix the software is to wade into the muck yourself and help with reporting and
fixing bugs. This is a double-edged sword, because in one way it gives you
freedom and absolute control, but on the other hand, for a student looking to
use a glitch-free software on his computer to pass a course, well&hellip;</p>
<p>I would like to point out that even though I&rsquo;ve bashed FreeCAD quite a bit for
bugs, do note that <a href="https://www.cadalyst.com/cad/product-design/what-grounded-airbus-a380-10903">even using the most premier CAD packages don&rsquo;t save you
from bugs</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p><sup>1</sup> IITD lingo for Pro :P</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> Blender was initially started as an in-house creation tool and
had significant corporate backing from the start, which explains it&rsquo;s superiority
in overall fit, finish and polish to other kludgy open-source softwares. The
Blender community (Both developers and artists) have also done an awesome job
keeping the software relevant and up-to-date. More on this <a href="https://www.blender.org/foundation/history/">here</a></p>
