  <div>
    <p>For IIT admissions, I had created a small command line tool called <code>iit_dep_finder.py</code> 
to check the departments I would get, given a particular rank. Once the round 
one allocation results came out, I decided to create a web version, for others 
to use as well. This article chronicles the steps I took, and while I did get 
the department finder up and running, I also did a lot of other stuff in the 
process (including changing the domain name, in case you haven't noticed :). 
It's a long and uncensored article, so be warned.</p>

<h2>Flask App Development</h2>
<p>Developing the Flask app was probably the most rewarding part of the process, 
considering that the rest of it was DevOps, which is not exactly my cup of 
tea. I started out by downloading the data from 
<a href="https://josaa.nic.in/Result/Result/currentorcr.aspx">https://josaa.nic.in/Result/Result/currentorcr.aspx</a>
as a set of HTML files, to retain their tabular format. The data was then 
scraped with BeautifulSoup and LXML into a CSV intermediate using the following
snippet of code:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">main_table</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">soup</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;table&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;class&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">&quot;border_table_at&quot;</span><span class="p">})</span>
<span class="n">table_rows</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">main_table</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find_all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;tr&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>

<span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">row</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">table_rows</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">cells</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">row</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">find_all</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;td&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">cell</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">cells</span><span class="p">:</span>
        <span class="n">field</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">cell</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">text</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">strip</span><span class="p">()</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">field</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Female-only (including Supernumerary)&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span>
            <span class="n">field</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">field</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot; (including Supernumerary)&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="n">outfile</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">field</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">replace</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;,&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">&quot;,&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">outfile</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The CSV file was then cleaned up a bit manually, such as removing commas at the
end of the line and changing a few typos and values. After this, I created the 
SQLite database and added a table, whose schema was as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="k">IF</span> <span class="k">NOT</span> <span class="k">EXISTS</span> <span class="ss">&quot;orcr_2020_r1&quot;</span><span class="p">(</span>
    <span class="n">institute</span> <span class="nb">varchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">256</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">department</span> <span class="nb">varchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">256</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">quota</span> <span class="nb">varchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">category</span> <span class="nb">varchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">gender</span> <span class="nb">varchar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">32</span><span class="p">),</span>
    <span class="n">OPR</span> <span class="nb">integer</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">OPR_prep</span> <span class="nb">integer</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">CPR</span> <span class="nb">integer</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="n">CPR_prep</span> <span class="nb">integer</span>
<span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This was enough to store the required data. Notice the <code>OPR\_prep</code> and <code>CPR\_prep</code> 
fields, which are there for <a href="https://www.iitism.ac.in/assets/pdfs/rules/pcr.pdf">Preparatory Course ranklists</a>.
The ranks for these ranklists have a 'P' appended to the number. Since we want 
to store the number as an integer for sorting purposes, the 'P' needs to be 
abstracted into this boolean-esque field. After the table was created, it was 
a matter of inserting all the records in the CSV file into the table. The CSV 
file was used as a sort of 'staging location' for easily editing any errors in 
the data or tweaking formatting. </p>
<p>Once the data creation methodology and tools were done, I moved on to developing
the flask backend. There's nothing spectacular here, it was just querying the 
database based on the JSON data it received from the frontend and returning 
the results as a JSON encoded string. This part was probably the simplest, 
because the rest was pretty tricky.</p>
<h2>Frontend Development</h2>
<p>I'm finally able to understand why Javascript developers use such humongous 
frontend development frameworks like Angular and React: Frontend development
without those is a huge pain in the ass</p>
<p><img alt="Commitstrip comic" src="https://www.commitstrip.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Strip-Les-bonnes-r%C3%A9solutions-650-finalenglish.jpg"></p>
<p>This is a close second for the most disliked part of this entire development 
cycle: writing HTML and CSS gets extremely repetitive. Since I was not using 
any framework, all the CSS (including the little dropdown transitions for 
advanced options) were written by hand. The JavaScript backend was slightly 
better, but JS does indeed feel like a hacky kludge of a language rather than
something you can write an entire frontend app with (like google sheets), or 
maybe that's because I'm an amateur at the language.</p>
<p>Once the frontend was done, it didn't look too nasty. I still have to optimize 
the frontend for mobile devices, but since I used <code>div</code>'s for the layout, I don't 
think there's going to be much to do.</p>
<p><img alt="Frontend preview" src="res/iit_dep_finder_frontend.gif"></p>
<h2>NGINX and GUnicorn local setup</h2>
<p>This is where the 'Flask 101' tutorials generally stop. Flask uses Werkzeug to
serve it's files in the development stage, and you cannot carry that forward
to production. Flask is merely a microframework to do the routing and keep 
the application logic in the backend. You need an application server to act as 
an interface for Flask and a web server to serve the static files, because 
the application server is not optimized to do that. I went with NGINX because 
it's light and smaller than apache, and GUnicorn because it's pretty well 
documented. </p>
<p>Before deploying the app on a VPS, I had to setup the same environment on my 
local machine. I was following this brilliant <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-serve-flask-applications-with-gunicorn-and-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04">DigitalOcean tutorial</a>
but it proved to be tedious, because I'm using a mac, and UNIX-y
stuff like <code>systemctl</code> and <code>launchd</code> don't play well (actually they don't play
at all) on a mac. I then had to switch gears a bit and follow some part of 
<a href="http://cheng.logdown.com/posts/2015/01/27/deploy-django-nginx-gunicorn-on-mac-osx">Cheng's blog</a>
on setting up a similar development setup on Mac OS X. The long and short of it 
is that NGINX on Mac doesn't ship with the <code>sites-available</code> and <code>sites-enabled</code>
folders, so you will have to create them manually and add the <code>sites-enabled</code> one
to <code>nginx.conf</code>. Once that is done, I made the <code>iit_dep_finder.conf</code> config 
file in <code>sites-available</code> and linked it to <code>sites-enabled</code>. One point of difference
is the redirection of the API commands to the server; on the Mac machine, 
GUnicorn runs on port 9000, whereas on the Ubuntu server, I can create a service 
which has it's own socket, with the <code>unix:</code> prefix. This difference is 
reflected in the server, where I made a custom <code>gunicorn_prod.conf.py</code>.</p>
<p>I had a lot of troubles with routing: the NGINX config files are not exactly 
very intuititve, and finally going to the docs and learning the difference 
between <code>root</code> and <code>alias</code> fixed it. <code>root</code> appends everything in the location
to the specified path, whereas <code>alias</code> appends only the content after the 
location to the specified path. </p>
<p>Once routing was fixed on the Mac, I did a test deployment to a Ubuntu machine
I had hooked up to my local network, which was a success. I was then ready to 
move to the next part</p>
<h2>Lightsail (VPS) Setup and Deployment</h2>
<p>This part ran in parallel with the development for a few days: turns out that 
Amazon needs you to fill in your payment details along with doing a phone 
number verification before your account setup is complete and you can use any
of their services. This is really misleading, when they advertise a 'free month'.
It's free only in the sense that they're not drawing any blood, but the needle 
will be firmly inserted and kept in your flesh, ready to draw blood once the 
month is over. Amazon is not the only provider to use this strategy: all SaaS/PaaS/Services
companies are doing this now. This will turn into a full fledged rant if I 
continue, so more on this in a later blog post maybe.</p>
<p>After going back and forth with Amazon support over a couple days, my account 
was finally given a stamp of approval and allowed to partake in the holy services
of AWS. I created the cheapest LightSail instance (with a free month :P) and 
<strong>assigned a static IP to it</strong>. This step is important, and Amazon does not 
do it automatically. After that, download the default SSH key and use it to 
SSH into the server from your terminal. You can now proceed to start installing
stuff: <code>apt</code> works here, so does <code>snap</code>. The setup was pretty similar to the 
stuff I did on the local ubuntu machine, and once it was done, I could access
the site by entering the static IP in my web browser.</p>
<h2>Domain Acquisition and Setup</h2>
<p>This was decently tricky for me, as I knew nothing about DNS and domain routing 
and related concepts. I purchased a domain off GoDaddy, and it was not a good 
experience. GoDaddy provides pretty cheap domains compared to the competition, 
and they try to poke money out of you in every other way. Still, the domain 
setup and update times were pretty good, and I had linked my primary domain to 
my server in under 2 hours. Not bad for a n00b like me.</p>
<p>The following day, I read more about DNS records, what A, CNAME and TXT records
are. I then went ahead and created a small sitemap for my website, since I 
would also host my blog on the website</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">www</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">aniruddhadeb</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">Blog</span> <span class="n">linked</span> <span class="k">to</span> <span class="n">GitHub</span> <span class="n">pages</span>
    <span class="o">-</span> <span class="o">/&lt;</span><span class="n">Project</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">Project</span> <span class="n">websites</span> <span class="k">from</span> <span class="n">GitHub</span>

<span class="n">apps</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">aniruddhadeb</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">com</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">My</span> <span class="n">webapps</span>
    <span class="o">-</span> <span class="o">/&lt;</span><span class="n">App</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">single</span> <span class="n">webapp</span> <span class="n">page</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">in</span> <span class="n">this</span> <span class="k">case</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">IIT_dep_finder</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The URL for this project would then be <code>http://apps.aniruddhadeb.com/IIT_dep_finder</code>. 
I then had to add a CNAME to my DNS record with the <code>apps</code> prefix and redirect
it to the LightSail static IP. Following this, I linked up a custom domain with
GitHub Pages, the process for which is well documented <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site">here</a>.
This was all on the domain side of things, and I had to configure my NGINX server
to serve from <code>/IIT_dep_finder</code> instead of from the root, which was frustruating 
because I'm not that good with the NGINX config. Practice makes perfect, as they 
say, and I'm a greenfoot when it comes to full stack development.</p>
<p>When all was said and done, I had a running website, with my blog on the main 
page and IIT dep finder on the URL above. All was good! or was it?</p>
<h2>Enabling SSL and Security</h2>
<p>This takes the cake for the most frustruating part of development. Not because 
acquiring and setting up an SSL certificate was hard (Thank you to <code>certbot</code>!), 
but because <strong>Amazon has their own fucking firewall in front of the LightSail 
instance</strong>, and it took me 3 hours to figure that out. Important disclaimer for
all out there on LightSail: <strong>If you create a default ubuntu instance, ONLY 
ports <code>22</code> and <code>80</code> are enabled by default, which is why my server was getting 
NO HTTPS requests on <code>443</code></strong>. Setting up certbot was easy, as shown in the 
DigitalOcean tutorial above. CertBot takes your domain and hooks you up with an 
SSL certificate, which you have to renew every 90 days by typing in <code>certbot renew</code>.
Certbot also takes care of adding the certificate to your NGINX config automatically
so you don't have to do anything. However, when I tried hitting the link via 
<code>https://</code> instead of <code>http://</code>, the web browser would time out. I tried all 
of the follwing, in order after that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chrome inspector, to see if the request is going through. Request was going through</li>
<li>Change NGINX config to listen on port 80 and serve pages. Worked on port 80</li>
<li>Duplicated the NGINX config and ripped the SSL stuff, to go back to normal. Worked</li>
<li>Tried restoring the SSL config lines one line at a time. Did not work</li>
<li>Tailed the logs. Nothing coming in.</li>
<li>Realized that there might be a firewall. Checked <code>sudo ufw status</code>. Firewall 
  was inactive</li>
<li>Created a firewall and allowed selective ports through. No change, https:// 
  requests still timed out</li>
<li>Realized that LightSail might have it's own firewall. Logged in to lightsail
  and saw the firewall settings. </li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="motherfucker" src="https://i.gifer.com/2Jc.gif"></p>
<p>Needless to say, I took the rest of the day off after that.</p>
<h2>Conclusion and next steps</h2>
<p>While I have a website that is fortunately up and running well, there are still
a lot of things left to do. Some of those include:
- Registering on search engines
- SEO with sitemaps and <code>robots.txt</code>
- Adding Google Analytics
- Adding some ads?
- Improvements on the app itself: more cutoff data and smarter suggestions</p>
<p>All of these things will be tackled one by one, but developing and setting up
my first full stack app was a challenging experience and certainly one of the
trickier projects I have undertaken so far.</p>
