  <section><p>Just after 10th and as I was beginning my JEE Preparation, I felt the need for
an extensible note-taking apparatus. Online notes would be too much trouble
and would keep me hooked to the computer. Notebooks were also difficult, as
I wanted my notes to be extensible; adding pages in the middle of a notebook
is extremely difficult. I finally settled on using Binders; you can add/remove
pages quite easily and they&rsquo;re decently sized to accommodate all the notes you
could ever need.</p>
<p>I took out two old binders; they had ~120 pages each and used one for math and
one for physics. Soon enough, I had to get more pages and by the end of my
JEE Journey, the binders had somewhere around 200 pages, each filled with notes</p>
<p><img src="res/mathnotes/binders.jpg" alt="Binders"></p>
<p><sup>Left one is maths, right one is physics</sup></p>
<p><img src="res/mathnotes/monotonicity.jpg" alt="monotonicity"></p>
<p><img src="res/mathnotes/PnC.jpg" alt="PnC"></p>
<p><img src="res/mathnotes/MI.jpg" alt="MI"></p>
<p>These tend to follow a very hierarchical format, and also tend to be extremely
diverse with symbols and diagrams (I did all the notes in pencil, so that if
any errors arise, I can change the content).</p>
<p>I now needed a note-taking repository that had the same level of extensibility
and one that I could use through college life. The computer was not a limitation
now, and I was also decently skilled in LaTeX by now. I decided to make an
online website using Sphinx and Read the docs, for keeping my math notes.</p>
<p>I followed the great guide by Ryan Dale on <a href="https://daler.github.io/sphinxdoc-test/includeme.html">settting up sphinx on GitHub Pages</a>.
I took a few liberties with the folder structure, but now setting up the repo
for contributors is as simple as cloning the repo and running the <code>install.sh</code>
script in it.
The website is now live at <a href="https://aniruddha-deb.github.io/MathNotes">https://aniruddha-deb.github.io/MathNotes</a>,
and I will be porting all my math and physics content over, and also creating
notes in the future, for the math courses that I take.</p>
<p>This means that this blog would feature fewer &lsquo;Math Notes&rsquo; sections that I
spoke about previously (link <a href="https://aniruddha-deb.github.io/articles/2020/math-notes-1.html">here</a>).
The math content will also go down, but I will continue to write about math
stuff that made me go &lsquo;wow&rsquo; (there are a few of those coming in the future,
so stay tuned)</p>
<p>If you would like to contribute to the math notes repository, feel free to
reach out to me on my eMail, by clicking the mail icon in the sidebar.</p>
