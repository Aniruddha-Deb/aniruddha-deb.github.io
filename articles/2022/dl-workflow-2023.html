    <p>I've kind of zeroed down on Deep Learning at this point, and putting my money
where my mouth is, will be taking both COL772 (Natural Language Processing) and
COL775 (Deep Learning) next semester.</p>
<p>Along with Operating Systems, Parallel Programming and Theory of Computation.</p>
<p><center>

<h2>Why a workflow?</h2>
<p>I'll need to train a lot of models, and while <a href="https://kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> and 
<a href="https://colab.research.google.com">Colab</a> are great at this, 30 hours a week 
won't cut it. So I'll need to move to using the 
<a href="https://supercomputing.iitd.ac.in">IITD HPC</a> to train some (most?) of my 
models.</p>
<p>Most of this article will be very HPC-specific: the libraries, environment and
everything else involved in the setup probably (and thankfully) won't need to 
be replicated anywhere else, but the entire environment is something I'll 
probably use throughout next semester. </p>
<p>If you're reading this as a HPC getting started guide, this is not it. Ruturaj
has published a great guide for that <a href="https://github.com/kanha95/HPC-IIT-Delhi">here</a>, 
and you should check that out as an introduction. This is a tad bit more 
advanced.</p>
<h2>Mission Statement</h2>
<p>I need an environment that will let me train the same model on both kaggle and
the HPC. Preferably do my initial EDA/debug runs on kaggle and then finetune/do 
production runs on the HPC. </p>
<p>Let's look at a Pro/Con matrix for both platforms:</p>
<table>
<tr>
  <th></th>
  <th>Kaggle</th>
  <th>HPC</th>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #bae3b399;">
  <td style="vertical-align: middle;"> <b>Pro</b> </td>
  <td><ul>
    <li>Easy to use! Versioning, running and working with data is super easy</li>
    <li>Good GPU's (T4 x2, P100)</li>
    <li>Large, Common datasets already there</li>
  </ul></td>
  <td><ul>
    <li>No 12h limit, so run really long jobs!</li>
    <li>Allocate as much hardware as you need (8 GPU rig go brr)</li>
    <li>Get Skylake nodes if you're lucky or have funding (with 32GB V100 cards)</li>
  </ul></td>
</tr>
<tr style="background-color: #f0b9b499;">
  <td style="vertical-align: middle;"> <b>Con</b> </td>
  <td><ul>
    <li>Only 30 hours a week</li>
    <li>Working with notebooks/datasets without a proper filesystem may get 
        tedious for larger models</li>
  </ul></td>
  <td><ul>
    <li>Slow, outdated GPU on haswell nodes (K40)</li>
    <li>Super complicated versioning and environment management</li>
    <li>System versions of software/libraries are antiquated and unreliable</li>
  </ul></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>So, if we're shifting to HPC, we need:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Live Notebook environment</strong>: JupyterLab running on HPC would be great to 
  test/debug stuff: no ML model runs at the first go, and it's foolish to
  assume that every model we run will just be some python script that we'll
  need to train. Exploring and interacting with models is part of the job
  description</li>
<li><strong>Seamless Kaggle Integration</strong>: This is quite important, as we should be 
  directly able to jump from kaggle to HPC if needed, and the way this is
  finally implemented is via GitHub integration with Kaggle, and Papermill+Git
  on HPC to run notebooks (some config stuff, such as input/output directories
  are involved, which I'll get to later)</li>
<li><strong>A Proper Installable Environment</strong>: This was initially set up with Conda, 
  but because conda throws tantrums if the bashrc is not set according to it's
  tastes, all I used conda for was to setup the initial virtual environment.
  From there, it's easier to directly activate the virtual environment yourself
  and use pip.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Setup Process</h2>
<p>This section started out as being very procedural, but I think a good grasp of
how the HPC works is more important. For starters, all relevant software that
you need is loaded in at runtime via <a href="https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Environment
modules</a>. These use modulefiles, 
which look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">module</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">whatis</span> <span class="s2">&quot;what this module does&quot;</span>

<span class="n">module</span> <span class="nb">load</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">modules_this_module_depends_on</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">...</span>

<span class="n">prepend</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">path</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">PATH_VAR</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">path_to_append</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">...</span>

<span class="n">setenv</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">ENV_FLAGS</span><span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="n">args</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="o">...</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is great, but it's also super complicated to make a module and load a
module by yourself. You can only install software to your home directory, not
being admin, and modules are loaded from <code>MODULEPATH</code> (which is
<code>/home/soft/modules</code> on HPC). You could append <code>~/.local/modules</code> to
<code>MODULEPATH</code> on login, and then define your own modules, but that's still
fairly complicated. </p>
<p>Since we're only going to be working with Python, using a virtual environment
is a better option. The python on HPC, however, has some hidden hacks.
Examining the module file for <code>apps/anaconda/3</code> gives us the following two 
lines:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>set             TOP                     /home/apps/anaconda3_2018/4.6.9
...
setenv          PYTHON_ROOT             $TOP          
prepend-path    PYTHONPATH      $TOP/lib/python3.6/site-packages
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is an issue, because after activating this module, <code>python2</code> stops working
because the <code>PYTHONPATH</code> has been changed. This means that your python proxy
script won't run! (3EnvCreation also does the same, although that sets <code>TOP</code> as
<code>/home/apps/anaconda3/5.2.0/gnu</code>). Activating an environment also causes issues
when you're doing it on a job, as <code>.bashrc</code> is not called while running a job,
and conda, as said previously, throws tantrums when it's not configured in your
<code>.bashrc</code></p>
<p>The way we work around this is to create your conda environment AFTER activating
your proxy</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">module</span> <span class="nb">load</span> <span class="n">apps</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">anaconda</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="n">EnvCreation</span>
<span class="n">conda</span> <span class="n">create</span> <span class="o">--</span><span class="n">name</span> <span class="n">dl_35</span> <span class="n">python</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mf">3.7</span>
<span class="n">module</span> <span class="n">unload</span> <span class="n">apps</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">anaconda</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="n">EnvCreation</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Then pick up the <code>activate</code> script in <code>/home/apps/anaconda3/5.2.0/gnu/bin</code> 
(<code>/home/apps/anaconda3_2018/4.6.9/bin</code> if you made your env while using 
 <code>apps/anaconda/3</code>), and place that in your home folder, or somewhere 
accessible. To activate your environment, you can now directly call </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">source</span> path/to/activate path/to/env
</code></pre></div>

<p>for example, I have <code>activate</code> in my <code>scripts</code> directory, so I'll run</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">source</span> scripts/activate .conda/envs/dl_35
</code></pre></div>

<p>and it'll work, without loading any modules or without throwing errors that
conda isn't configured for your shell. Great!</p>
<p>The next task we come to is actually installing libraries on there. Most stuff
is simple to install, and can be done via pip, except PyTorch. One major issue
on HPC are the dated GPU's: they have CUDA compute capability 3.5, and that's
not compatible with PyTorch, even though cudatoolkit 10 supports this CUDA
compute version! The reason is that compiling PyTorch to so many platforms
would increase the size of the resulting binary, and they wouldn't be able to
push the binaries to conda and pip archives. </p>
<p>To work around this, you'll have to install a version of PyTorch compiled for
CUDA 3.5; <a href="https://github.com/nelson-liu/pytorch-manylinux-binaries/releases">Nelson Liu</a> 
has fortunately compiled some binaries, and they're great for getting PyTorch
to work. Follow the instructions and download and install the binary for your
python version only. The download itself is a bit large, so make sure you have
enough bandwidth left on your proxy.</p>
<p>That covers most of what I did. I installed Jupyter, pandas, numpy, matplotlib,
plotly, scikit-learn and the usual suspects on my virtual environment, along
with some JupyterLab plugins and <a href="https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">papermill</a>,
which is also what Kaggle uses to run their notebooks.</p>
<h2>Any Good?</h2>
<p>I would be working on GAN's next semseter, so let's see if we can get StyleGAN2
up and running on our setup</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>qsub scripts/nbserver.sh
</code></pre></div>

<p>This runs a jupyter server with 4 CPU's, 1 GPU and 16G of memory for 2 hours; 
you can modify the parameters and runtime by downloading and customizing the
script from <a href="https://gist.github.com/Aniruddha-Deb/2d48ba5ef8fcb853024a994b7cc73531">here</a>,
but for now let's continue. Once our server is up and running, we'll get an
email and we can check the output logs to get the URL for the server, and we're
good to go</p>
<p><img alt="jupyter on HPC" src="res/jupyter_hpc.png"></p>
<p>I've cloned the <a href="https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch">StyleGAN2</a> 
PyTorch implemenation, and downloaded the weights trained on FFHQ from 
<a href="https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/stylegan2-ada-pytorch/">here</a>. Then made a 
notebook in the same directory and followed the examples</p>
<p>Let's generate one image!</p>
<p><img alt="One image" src="res/one_stylegan_image.png"></p>
<p>Not too bad. Let's do 10 now</p>
<p><img alt="Ten faces" src="res/ten_faces.png"></p>
<h2>What Next?</h2>
<p>I still haven't gotten around to synergising kaggle with HPC, but it looks very
doable. Kaggle integrates with GitHub well: you can link your notebooks and
commit to GitHub with each kaggle commit. Papermill can pass parameters to a
cell that's been tagged as 'parameters' using Jupyter. All I'll have to do is
commit to GitHub from Kaggle, open up the notebook on HPC and mark the cell
as parameters (I'll have the input and output directories here, along with some
hyperparameters, and I can standardize this across all my scripts), and then
run the notebook with Papermill.</p>
<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p>I've been at home for the past three weeks and have been prepping for a large(ish)
article to start 2023 with: an optimizer playground, with some interactive
charts. Stay tuned for that!</p>
