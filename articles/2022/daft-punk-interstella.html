    <p>In 2001, Daft Punk were nowhere near the mask-rocking superstars they are today. 
The only album they had to their credit was their debut, <em>Homework</em>, and their 
robot masks hadn't even materialized yet. In 2001, they came out with <em>Discovery</em>,
Which in many ways has defined their music style and approach for the 21st 
century.</p>
<h2>The Importance of Discovery</h2>
<p>Daft Punk didn't have their helmets before discovery. </p>
<p>Let that sink in. Their most iconic feature came about as a story they wove, 
that there was "An Accident in the Studio", and since then, the helmets 
themselves have become more iconic than Thomas and Guy. If they choose, they 
could let the legend live on by handing down the helmets to someone else. </p>
<p>But we deviate.</p>
<p>The sounds in Discovery are very wide ranging: from the lyrical <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=TZhxu5iCDnI&amp;feature=share">Too Long</a> to the
deep <a href="https://music.youtube.com/watch?v=POSwzCFwUZ0&amp;feature=share">Veridis Quo</a>. 
There's a lot of variety, and while most would just listen to One More Time and 
Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger and think they're representative of the kind 
of work Daft Punk does (electronic disco pop with vocoder-ed vocals), that's 
far from the truth, and every song in this album has a story to tell. The story
of a band that's morphing into what they will be for the next two decades.</p>
<h2>Interstella 5555</h2>
<p>So if every song has a story to tell, how do we tell it? Daft Punk initially
planned to release every record on Discovery as a single, with an accompanying
music video. If you've seen the MV's for <em>One More Time</em> and <em>Harder, Better,
Faster, Stronger</em>, great. If not, let me refresh your memory. </p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gAjR4_CbPpQ" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FGBhQbmPwH8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>you would've felt an overarching theme there. What ties these (and a couple other 
MV's) together? In a Pink Floyd-esque move, rather than releasing individual
MV's, Daft Punk decided to chain together all the songs in Discovery together
to make a complete musical. If that wasn't enough to get you excited, they tied
up with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leiji_Matsumoto">Leiji Matsumoto</a> to
make it animated rather than live-action.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Qxe-QOp_-s" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>This was amazing to see as a daft punk fan: The entire story is beautiful, and 
is about an alien band that's abducted, shipped off to Earth and made to play 
corporate pop for profiting a major record label. The story is about how they 
escape this. What's even more interesting is that none of the characters ever 
speak: it's all just animation and lyrics. Letting the music speak for the
characters is amazing, and while it's easy on the ears and eyes of the viewers, 
I can only imagine how hard it must have been as an artist to create such 
coherence.</p>
<h2>A Deeper Dive</h2>
<p>I've just watched this once: more trivia always pops up when I see something 
multiple times, but what's immediately noticeable is <a href="https://www.vulture.com/2018/04/how-2001-a-space-odyssey-has-influenced-pop-culture.html">The 2001 effect</a></p>
<p><img alt="anime" src="res/space_odyssey_1.png"></p>
<p><img alt="odyssey" src="res/space-odyssey-red.jpg"></p>
<p><img alt="anime" src="res/space_odyssey_2.png"></p>
<p><img alt="odyssey" src="res/space_odyssey_light_tunnel.jpg"></p>
<p>Another bit of trivia: even though Daft Punk makes a cameo in the awards scene 
(Of course they do, they're <em>Daft Punk</em>!), This scene is filled with tributes 
to people whose music Daft Punk have sampled for Discovery.</p>
<p><img alt="Daft Punk cameo" src="res/daft_punk.png"></p>
<p>Here's Sister Sledge. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qyL2yN88pI">IL Macquilage Lady</a> was sampled for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L93-7vRfxNs">Aerodynamic</a></p>
<p><img alt="sister sledge" src="res/sister_sledge.png"></p>
<p>And this is Eddie Johns (?), from whom <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYya05epoZ8&amp;feature=youtu.be">More Spell on You</a> was sampled for One More Time</p>
<p><img alt="eddie johns" src="res/eddie_johns.png"></p>
<p>These are the Spice Girls?</p>
<p><img alt="spice girls" src="res/spice_girls.png"></p>
<p>I'm pretty sure this one is Mozart? (This comes later in the movie)</p>
<p><img alt="mozart" src="res/mozart.png"></p>
<p>And this is Bob Marley?</p>
<p><img alt="marley" src="res/bob_marley.png"></p>
<p>And this is Robert Plant?</p>
<p><img alt="rob plant" src="res/robert_plant.png"></p>
<p>I have zero clue who these two are, although they should be famous. Let me know 
in the comments!</p>
<p><img alt="no idea" src="res/no_idea_1.png">

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is a pure visual treat if you're into Daft Punk, and it was an amazing 
experience delving into their discography. Some of the songs they sampled are 
amazing in themselves, and I'll be listening to them more, as well as giving 
this another view and updating whatever I find :)</p>
