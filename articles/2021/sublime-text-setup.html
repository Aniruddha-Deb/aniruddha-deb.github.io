  <div>
    <p>After using vim for a <em>long</em> time, I realized that vim would be very tricky to
use for larger projects; there are a few reasons behind this, which are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Hard to set up and use autocomplete</strong>: I've tried omnicomplete, but it just didn't cut the mustard. I very seldom need something like whole line completion and all the other gimmicky stuff that was in it. I heard that setting up other autocompletes on vim were really tricky, and that vim by virtue of being single-threaded wasn't great at this stuff. I had used VSCode once, and the only thing I really took away was how great intellisense is. I really didn't want to go back to VSCode, so sublime seemed like a good alternative</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Where are the directories?</strong> There is no way to view folders in vim unless you have a folder viewing plugin. Once you have a good grip on the way of the keyboard, Vim is kind of pointless until you start adding plugins. You even need a plugin to add auto-completing brackets! I finally realized that vim would be hard to use realistically if I have to tackle a larger programming project, where I would need to see the folders and files and have autocomplete on hand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Neovim? Do I have to set that up?</strong> NeoVim is the 'better' version of vim that everyone uses, because it's multithreaded and more of a community effort. however that has another bunch of setup for making it usable, and coc.nvim is the completion tool of choice there. Though I could have gone the nvim way, I decided that setting up sublime text would be effort better spent, since it's already usable and fast. </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So here's the way I made sublime my own over a tuesday evening:</p>
<h3>Update, Update, Update!</h3>
<p>Everytime I opened up Sublime, I was greeted with the annoying update window<sup>1</sup></p>
<p><center><img alt="Yes I didn't screenshot it on my mac, which is why it's a windows SS, thanks to Colonel Panic at StackOverflow for the image" src="res/sublime_update.png"></center></p>
<p>I finally went ahead and updated it. Sublime text had come up with version 4 recently, and the only change was <em>drumrolls</em> A new default color scheme! How original.<sup>2</sup>. Well, it's still a great color scheme, even I was getting bored of monokai.</p>
<h3>Installing the smaller plugins</h3>
<p>There are 3 'small' plugins I installed (plugins that require minimal work to setup):</p>
<ol>
<li>A file Icon - cool file icons in the sublime text sidebar</li>
<li>Terminal - open a terminal with the current file with one keystroke (⌘⇧T)</li>
<li>NeoVintageous - <em>much</em> improved vim plugin; vintageous pales in comparision</li>
</ol>
<p>all of these (except Terminal) required no setup; I just hit ⌘⇧P -&gt; install packages -&gt; type the package name in, hit enter and done. Terminal required that I specify that I have iTerm2 </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;terminal&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;iTerm2-v3.sh&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;parameters&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;--open-in-tab&quot;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Installing the larger autocomplete plugins</h3>
<p>I mainly code in C/C++/Python nowadays, so I needed a Python autocomplete, as well as a C/C++ autocompleter. Jedi is what I used to use for python a long time back, and surprisingly it's still quite well maintained and documented. I installed Jedi via the package control. Jedi has some interesting settings regarding projects and virtual environments; I didn't get to try any of those out, but I did set it up on the default python interpreter on my system. </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;python_interpreter&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/Users/Sensei/.pyenv/versions/3.9.0/bin/python&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;python_package_paths&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;/Users/Sensei/.pyenv/versions/3.9.0/lib/python3.9/site-packages&quot;</span>
    <span class="p">]</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>and that's it! Jedi now autocompletes both normal python and all packages that I install with pip (numpy, scipy etc). Great!</p>
<p>I was left with setting up a C++ autocompleter, and this was a bit tricky. The first recommendation that I encountered was for ClangAutoComplete, but after downloading it, it stated that the plugin is still maintained, but not very actively. ClangAutoComplete instead recommended EasyClangComplete, so I uninstalled it and downloaded ECC. ECC had a few setup issues; everything is hunky-dory if you use CMake, but since I don't, I had to tweak the preferences a bit. I had already ranted about <a href="https://aniruddhadeb.com/articles/2021/c-mac.html">How the C header locations on mac are screwed</a>, and fortunately the ECC folks were kind enough to provide a recommended path list for mac.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;common_flags&quot;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;-I/usr/include/&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;-I/usr/local/include&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;-I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/lib/clang/12.0.0&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
        <span class="s2">&quot;-I/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include/c++/v1&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;lang_flags&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;C&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;-std=c99&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;CPP&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;-std=c++14&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;OBJECTIVE_C&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;-std=c11&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
        <span class="nt">&quot;OBJECTIVE_CPP&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;-std=c++14&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="nt">&quot;libclang_path&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/lib/&quot;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<h3>Further updates</h3>
<p>The next day, I went ahead and realized that terminal wouldn't cut it, and I needed a terminal integrated into sublime text. I went ahead and installed the Terminus plugin for that. Terminus by default hides some of it's keybindings, so I had to go and change the keybinding user preferences. Now <code>alt+`</code> opens up a terminal where the default sublime terminal goes, and <code>ctrl+alt+T</code> opens up a terminal in place of a text pane. The default user theme was too dark for my taste, so I changed it with the 3024-dark theme that terminus ships with. This config works perfectly: no need to split sublime into two with a terminal, or open iTerm every time I use sublime! Here's a screenshot (the project in question is <a href="https://github.com/Aniruddha-Deb/PyGameOfLife">PyGameOfLife</a>)</p>
<p><img alt="Current sublime setup" src="res/sublime_ss.png"></p>
<p>That's about it; everything now works and works well! NeoVintageous is probably the thing that is the best; it is miles ahead of vintageous, and it works brilliantly here. I don't feel like I've left vim, until sublime writes methods for me, closes braces/tags for me and also autocompletes my 3 dimensional vector definition. Which is great. I'll post more updates here if I do install/delete some plugins, but I have a feeling sublime is here to stay.</p>

<p><sup>1</sup>Yes I didn't screenshot it on my mac, which is why it's a windows SS, thanks to Colonel Panic at StackOverflow for the image</p>
<p><sup>2</sup>They did change a lot of stuff; the rendering is now faster on newer devices, and a lot of updates would have gone into it behind the scenes, so this is just a joke :P gg @SublimeHQ, Sublime text 4 does look amazing :)</p>
