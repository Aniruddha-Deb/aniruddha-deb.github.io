      <description>I started reading CS theory in anticipation of my upcoming curriculum and I found that CLRS starts the reader off with sort algorithms (technically they start with math and basic CS, but I&amp;rsquo;ve already covered that). I decided to make a Sorting testbench, whose requirements were pretty simple:
It should be able to generate arrays of a given entropy: the entropy of an array is defined as the number of swaps required to sort the array.</description>
