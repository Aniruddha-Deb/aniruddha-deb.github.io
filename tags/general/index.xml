      <description>A friend recently asked me to provide some advice on department change to some freshers. The usual fundaebaazi is something I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do; it&amp;rsquo;s not impressionable, and won&amp;rsquo;t motivate any fresher to study for a department change. Instead, I chose to show and not tell
So is it luck or skill? Short answer: Both.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how first year courses are graded. For most theory courses (3 lecture hours + 1 tutorial hour / 2 lab hours), there&amp;rsquo;s a normal distribution of marks, and the top 7% of people on this distribution get an A.</description>

      <description>In 2001, Daft Punk were nowhere near the mask-rocking superstars they are today. The only album they had to their credit was their debut, Homework, and their robot masks hadn&amp;rsquo;t even materialized yet. In 2001, they came out with Discovery, Which in many ways has defined their music style and approach for the 21st century.
The Importance of Discovery Daft Punk didn&amp;rsquo;t have their helmets before discovery.
Let that sink in.</description>

      <description>We passed upon the stair
We spoke of was and when
Although I wasn&amp;rsquo;t there
He said I was his friend
Which came as a surprise
I spoke into his eyes
&amp;ldquo;I thought you died alone,
A long long time ago&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Oh no, not me
I never lost control
You&amp;rsquo;re face to face
With the man who sold the world&amp;rdquo;
I laughed and shook his hand
And made my way back home</description>

      <title>Cold Showers, Adulting and More</title>

      <description>Day 249 of taking a cold shower. It&amp;rsquo;s something I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing since April, and although the temperature has fallen and the geyser in my bathroom has been fixed come winter, it&amp;rsquo;s a habit I want to keep. Nothing makes you feel as alive as a cold shower does.
Speaking of durations, it&amp;rsquo;s also been exactly a month since my last post. A lot has happened since, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been too wrapped up in the happenings to get time to post here once a week.</description>

      <title>Freedom, Recaptured.</title>

      <description>With the creation of my official website (safari butchers the CSS :/), I&amp;rsquo;ve now got more creative liberty and artistic freedom on the content I post here.
When I first made this blog, it used to be my own little corner of the internet. That changed once more people got to know about it, and I subconsciously put more pressure on myself to keep a strong technical background to whatever I post.</description>
