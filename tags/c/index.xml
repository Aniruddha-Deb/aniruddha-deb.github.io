      <description>C development on a Mac has it&amp;rsquo;s fair share of traps and pitfalls, even though Mac is supposed to be POSIX compliant. I&amp;rsquo;ll cover a few of them here, with the hope that nobody repeats the same mistakes :)
XCode CLT Pitfalls The first thing one does while starting out with C development is to install a compiler. This is slightly more complicated than it looks on Mac: the simple way is to go the way of installing XCode command line tools, but there&amp;rsquo;s a few things here to note:</description>
