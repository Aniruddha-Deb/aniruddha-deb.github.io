      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s easy to mess up.
Of course. That&amp;rsquo;s what the title says. It seems like general advice, and making mistakes is part of life. You should &amp;ldquo;pick yourself up, brush yourself off and continue on your way!&amp;rdquo;
Not always.
Stubbing your toe on the couch is okay. Taking a major life decision on an impulse is not. Not choosing to back out of said decision even after multiple months have passed and the negative effects of that decision are evident in your life seems absurd, until you look around and realize that most people are doing this.</description>
