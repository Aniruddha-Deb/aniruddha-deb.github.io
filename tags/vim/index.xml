      <description>When in Neovim, Do as the Luans do
Unless you&amp;rsquo;re just starting out with Neovim or are extremely used to vim, it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to set up Neovim using neovim-exclusive plugins. Most of them are written in lua, and integrate more nicely with the Neovim environment (async, faster startup, support for LSP and treesitter, etc).
My initial neovim setup was just a clone of my vim setup, but when I noticed NERDTree wasn&amp;rsquo;t loading large directories quickly, I searched for a lighter, async file tree plugin for Neovim and came across NvimTree, and not long after, all my vim plugins were replaced with their neovim equivalents.</description>
