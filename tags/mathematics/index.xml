      <title>Luck, Skill or Both: Department Change at IITs</title>

      <description>A friend recently asked me to provide some advice on department change to some freshers. The usual fundaebaazi is something I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do; it&amp;rsquo;s not impressionable, and won&amp;rsquo;t motivate any fresher to study for a department change. Instead, I chose to show and not tell
So is it luck or skill? Short answer: Both.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how first year courses are graded. For most theory courses (3 lecture hours + 1 tutorial hour / 2 lab hours), there&amp;rsquo;s a normal distribution of marks, and the top 7% of people on this distribution get an A.</description>

      <title>Batch Normalization</title>
      <link>https://aniruddhadeb.com/blog-port/articles/2023/batch-normalization/</link>

      <description>$$ \require{physics} \newcommand{B}{\mathcal{B}}$$
Batch Normalization was proposed by Ioffe and Szegedy in 2015, and it spawned several normalization techniques that are used in SOTA models today (layer norm, weight norm, etc). Batch normalization normalizes the output of each layer based on the mean and variance of the examples in the current batch. Formally, if $\B = {x_1, \ldots, x_m}$ is our batch, then batch norm does the following transformation:
$$\begin{align} \mu_{\B} &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{m} \sum_i x_i \\ \sigma_{\B}^2 &amp;amp;= \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_i x_i^2 \right) - \mu_{\B}^2 \\ \hat{x}_i &amp;amp;= \frac{x_i - \mu_{\B}}{\sqrt{\sigma^2_{\B} + \epsilon}} \\ y_i &amp;amp;= \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta \end{align}$$</description>

      <title>L2 regularization intuition</title>
      <link>https://aniruddhadeb.com/blog-port/articles/2023/l2-regularization/</link>

      <guid>https://aniruddhadeb.com/blog-port/articles/2023/l2-regularization/</guid>
      <description>A nice intuition for L2 regularization comes from having a prior on the distribution of parameters: the prior assumes that the parameters are close to zero. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that the prior is $\mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)$. The MAP estimate of the parameters would then be
$$\begin{align} \theta_{\text{MAP}} &amp;amp;= \text{argmax}_{\theta} ; P(\theta | D) \\ &amp;amp;= \text{argmax}_{\theta} ; P(D | \theta) P(\theta) \\ &amp;amp;= \text{argmax}_{\theta} ; \log P(D | \theta) + \log P(\theta) \end{align}$$</description>

Recap If you remember the note on random variables, then this picks up exactly where that left off.
Definition 1.1: A Measurable space $(X,\Sigma)$ consists of a set $X$ and a $\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma$ defined on $X$.
Recall that a $\sigma$-algebra is simply a collection of subsets over $X$ that is closed over unions, intersections and complements.
Definition 1.2: If $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are $\sigma$-algebras defined on $\Omega$ and $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{A}$, then $\mathcal{B}$ is a sub $\sigma$-algebra of $\mathcal{A}$</description>

      <description>I promised I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t look at the JEE 2022 paper, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t help sneaking a peek. As always, the professors currently making life difficult occasionally get a chance to make the life of all of India&amp;rsquo;s students difficult, and they never cease to amaze.
Welp, this will be a short one. Let&amp;rsquo;s cut to the chase!
The greatest integer less than or equal to $$\int_1^2 \log_2(x^3 + 1) dx + \int_1^{\log_2 9} (2^x - 1)^{1/3} dx$$ is _______</description>

      <title>A Note on Conditional Probability</title>

Consider $X \sim \text{Uniform}([0,1])$. What is $\cP{X &amp;gt; \frac{1}{2}}{X \in \mathbb{Q}}$ ?
At first glance, the answer seems simple: it’s 1/2! Closer inspection reveals that the event $X \in \mathbb{Q}$ is not measurable: the rationals have measure zero, hence from our high-school (perhaps even undergraduate) definition of conditional probability, the given probability should be undefined. However, the conditional probability does exist, and it equals 1/2.</description>

      <description>$\newcommand{\triple}{(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbf{P})}$$\newcommand{\P}{\mathbf{P}}$ This note on random variables follows as a result of confusing notation in several math textbooks. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain random variables (in measure theoretic terms) as verbosely as I can, and then prove some results. This article assumes that the reader is familiar with probability triples $\triple$, as well as a basic idea of what random variables are, in non-measure theory terms.

      <description>This is a short getting started article on LaTeX; Recently, one of our courses involved a bit of LaTeX work, and this is meant to be a short introduction on how to use LaTeX to explain one&amp;rsquo;s working.
Getting Started LaTeX (Pronounced lay-tech, stylized $\LaTeX$), at it&amp;rsquo;s core, is merely a text formatting system. One of the main differences between LaTeX and other programs such as MS word is that LaTeX is a WYSIWYM (What you see is what you mean) system, as compared to WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get) systems.</description>

The Jacobian Matrix Consider a function that maps reals to reals, $f:\Bbb{R} \to \Bbb{R}$. The linear approximation of this function is given by $$f(a+h) \approx f(a) + hf&amp;rsquo;(a)$$ This is pretty simple to do, and follows from taylor&amp;rsquo;s expansion upto the first order.
Let&amp;rsquo;s try expanding this concept to vector spaces. For a function $f:\Bbb{R}^n \to \Bbb{R}$, it&amp;rsquo;s linear approximation is given by $$f(\pmb{a} + \pmb{h}) \approx f(\pmb{a}) + \pmb{h}\cdot\nabla{f}(\a)$$ (bold type indicates vectors).</description>

      <description>Just after 10th and as I was beginning my JEE Preparation, I felt the need for an extensible note-taking apparatus. Online notes would be too much trouble and would keep me hooked to the computer. Notebooks were also difficult, as I wanted my notes to be extensible; adding pages in the middle of a notebook is extremely difficult. I finally settled on using Binders; you can add/remove pages quite easily and they&amp;rsquo;re decently sized to accommodate all the notes you could ever need.</description>

Let $A = \{ X = (x, y, z)^T : PX = 0 \text{ and } x^2+y^2+z^2=1 \}$, where $$P = \left[ \begin{array}{l l l}1&amp;amp;2&amp;amp;1 \\ -2&amp;amp;3&amp;amp;-4 \\ 1&amp;amp;9&amp;amp;-1 \end{array}\right]$$ then the set A:

      <description>This is a small set of posts that come into the category of &amp;ldquo;notes&amp;rdquo;: self-explanations of concepts that I have recently picked up and found interesting.
Lagrange Interpolation Lagrange Interpolation is a concept that allows us to find a polynomial of least degree passing through a given set of points. Specifically:
If $S = {(x_i, y_i) : x_i, y_i \in R, 1 \lt i \le n}$, then the polynomial of least degree passing through all the points in $S$ is given by $$P(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n L_i(x) \cdot y_i$$ where $$L_i(x) = \frac{(x-x_1)(x-x_2)&amp;hellip;(x-x_{i-1})(x-x_{i+1})&amp;hellip;(x-x_n)} {(x_i-x_1)(x_i-x_2)&amp;hellip;(x_i-x_{i-1})(x_i-x_{i+1})&amp;hellip;(x_i-x_n)}$$ or simply, $$P(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\prod_{r \ne i}(x-x_r)}{\prod_{r \ne i}{(x_i-x_r)}} \cdot y_i$$ note that the degree of polynomial $P &amp;lt; n$.</description>

      <description>My old man always used to say that there are two ways to solve a problem: there&amp;rsquo;s the horse way, and there&amp;rsquo;s the donkey way. The donkey way involves tedious calculations, whereas the horse way &amp;lsquo;cuts&amp;rsquo; through the problem. Take this problem as an example:
For each positive integer $n$, let $$y_n = ((n+1)(n+2)&amp;hellip;(n+n))^\frac1n$$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Let $[x]$ be the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. If $\lim_{n \to \infty} y_n = L$, then the value of $[L]$ is ______ ?</description>

C: Debu, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve that African integral you gave me.
Me: Ok, but why are you calling it African?
C: Because Africa is a really big continent, y&amp;rsquo;know?
Me: Ok, but isn&amp;rsquo;t Asia bigger?

      <guid>https://aniruddhadeb.com/blog-port/articles/2020/limit-higher-order-infinitesimals/</guid>
      <description>Simple limit problems consist of the form $\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{O_1(x)O_2(x)..}{O_a(x)O_b(x)..}$, such as $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin 3x \tan 2x \tan^{-1} 5x}{x^2 \ln(1+x)}$. Here, the infinitesimals are well defined and cancel out easily. Some trickier limit problems involve the difference of two infinitesimals. A good example is $\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\sin t - \tan t}{t^3}$. These kind of problems require expansions to solve them cleanly. L&amp;rsquo;Hopital rule is tedious as it will need to be repeated atleast thrice for this given limit, which involves infinitesimals of order 3.</description>

      <description>The USA currently stands at 1.76 million COVID-19 cases. That&amp;rsquo;s more than the next 5 nations combined. A large number of these cases are due to government inaction against the virus. The lack of a concerted lockdown across the country is also to blame. Here&amp;rsquo;s a graph showing the daily number of cases of COVID-19 in the USA.

      <description>The Previous COVID regression analysis was fairly accurate. However, the opening of lockdown offset the statistics a bit and now there are more number of projected cases. Here is a recomputation of the statistics, which projects an average of 172,000 cases by June 1 and 520,000 cases overall by August end.

      <description>This is a regression analysis attempt for the COVID-19 spread data. The graphs represent total cases per day. The Orange graph is USA, the smaller graph on the left is China and the graph on the right is India. A Standard gaussian curve of the form $Ae^{-b(x-c)^2}$ is fitted on the data manually (They don&amp;rsquo;t fit the USA data very well though)
The y-axis scale is 5000 cases/large division and 1000 cases/small division.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll begin this article by brushing up a few definitions:
A function is a mapping between two sets: the domain D and the codomain C.
It&amp;rsquo;s very important to note here that the function is the mapping itself, and not an element in the codomain or the domain. The function operates on an element in the domain to give an element in the codomain. Formally, we would write this function as $f:D \to C$</description>
