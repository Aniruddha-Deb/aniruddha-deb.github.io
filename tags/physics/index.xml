      <description>I generally don&amp;rsquo;t post stuff that is extremely specific to JEE, but this time I&amp;rsquo;m willing to make an exception.
A lot has been said about Concepts of Physics by Dr. H. C.Verma and it&amp;rsquo;s usefulness for JEE Preparation. The website itself claims that
Students from the past twenty years of JEE preparation used this book and have successfully cleared JEE. So, you cannot neglect this book. A common problem that was observed with many JEE aspirants is that they follow multiple books in parallel, thereby ending up in confusion.</description>

      <description>Consider the icosahedral resistance network shown in the following figure. Each edge is made of a rod of resistance $r$. Select the option(s) that is(are) correct:
![icosahedron]({static}res/icosa_res_net/icosa_1.png)
A) The resistance between points A and B is $\frac{r}{2}$
B) The resistance between points A and B is $\frac{r}{3}$
C) The resistance between any two adjacent vertices is $\frac{11r}{30}$
D) The resistance between any two adjacent vertices is $\frac{11r}{20}$
This question looks really tricky.</description>
