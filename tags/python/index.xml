      <description>After a few days of reading and furious coding, I&amp;rsquo;m happy to announce the creation of MLZoo: a set of ML algorithms in their natural habitat
MLZoo is a set of jupyter notebooks which would contain implementations of several ML algorithms on real world datasets: so far, I&amp;rsquo;ve implemented different flavours of regression, and plan to add quite a few more algorithms over the summer.

      <description>For IIT admissions, I had created a small command line tool called iit_dep_finder.py to check the departments I would get, given a particular rank. Once the round one allocation results came out, I decided to create a web version, for others to use as well. This article chronicles the steps I took, and while I did get the department finder up and running, I also did a lot of other stuff in the process (including changing the domain name, in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed :).</description>
