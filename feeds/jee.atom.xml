try to compress the past few months into this single post. Long story
short, my JEE(M) was held on 2nd September, in the evening shift. After giving 
my best and getting a 260/300, I was disappointed (putting it mildly) to see 
the CRL of 1861 on my screen. AITS JEE(A) Mocks followed, and after giving three 
of them, I had to give my BITSAT. I did not do any preparation, went and gave 
the exam and got a 422/450 (including bonus marks). This was enough for BITSP 
CSE, so my safety net was intact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another AITS Mock followed, which I pretty much aced (got an AIR of 28ish) and 
I was feeling pretty pumped up for the final exam. I chilled out post the mock, 
hanging out on StackExchage and revising the odd inorganic formula or two. The 
date of the exam finally came, and the papers were no easier than the AITS 
test I gave a week back (lol for those who say AITS are hard). I left 4 questions 
in the first paper, 6 in the second and did 2-3 silly mistakes overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the next week, I checked my paper out, computed the score from the answer 
key and saw that I was getting 245ish. I had taken a ton of negatives in Chem 
paper 2 and had also taken Giga as $10^6$ instead of $10^9$. I was expecting a 
rank in the 250-400 bracket, with 500 being an absolute worst case result. 
Best case department was Bombay EE, whereas worst case was Madras EE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Result day finally rolled around and I got a CRL rank of &lt;strong&gt;323&lt;/strong&gt; with 249 marks 
(258 positive marks). I had fallen in a little pocket, just outside of CSE but 
ahead of EE. Following an intensive search of the available departments and 
programmes, I realized that EE would be an absolute bore. I liked EE and had 
experience in it, but looking at the course structure and hearing about the 
profs, I stayed back from EE. KGP CSE closed at 30 ranks above me, so tough 
luck there. Maths and Computing at Delhi emerged as the frontrunner here, with
a CR of 314 last year. The Dual Degree programme was more optimistic for me, 
with a CR of 373. At this point, I was in a massive conundrum: a Dual Degree was
something that I was not considering from the start; is doing a Dual worth it? 
There were positives and negatives; positives being that I get an extra year 
to explore stuff and that I can skip a year on an MS and directly do a PhD if 
I want to. Negatives were that the value of an MTech from an IIT is very low
(IIT Lingo for MTech's is 'Matkas' (pots)). 
If I was considering Duals, then IITB EE Dual also entered the fray, because 
of it's CR of 500ish something, and IITB had been a target of sorts during my 
preparation, so an emotional factor was also present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, I decided to screw emotion; taking EE dual with hopes of a Department 
change was not a good decision, and IIT Delhi Maths and Computing won over. 
I would get the 4 year degree if I was lucky or I
would take the dual degree, without any regrets. I got the dual in both my 
mock seat allocations and also in the first round of seat allocation. Looking 
at the closing ranks across all 7 rounds from last year, I realized that there
is no change in the top 100 and very little (couple seats) in the top 500, so
this is it. The fat lady has sung, and I'll be packing my bags for Delhi whenever 
the pandemic blows over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I thought about offering some pearls of advice to others by penning down the 
story of the past two years; I wrote a draft, but it was too lengthy, too 
egocentric and too offensive. Unfortunately, I'm not very good at talking or 
writing about myself, and the story would piss off more people than I can count. 
I would like to thank those who have been on this journey with me, starting with
my Parents: suffice it to say that I wouldn't have made it this far in life without 
them, and any attempts to thank them in words will not do their efforts justice.
Most of my time was spent with my Textbooks (mostly Cengage series and couple of 
Sri Balaji texts), so kudos to the authors of those. My Notebooks were amazing 
(I filled around 60-70 of those, and each was ~120 pages) and bore my frustrated 
scribbles without complaint when I couldn't solve problems. Thank you as well 
to all nonliving things and articles I used in this journey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not take a classroom coaching course, so no teachers to be thanked there. 
I would like to thank FIITJEE for AITS: the hardest test series 
out there. The problems from here were great (note that not all of them were 
original; quite a few were lifted from IPhO, IChO, INPhO, IMO, HMMT etc) and 
truly tested my abilities. Shout out to the community over at Physics, Chemistry 
and Math StackExchange for answering most of my stupid questions, and some 
not-so-stupid ones. Another mention for my school, for indirectly helping me 
out with the ISC curriculum. Thanks also to all the seniors whom I reached out 
to following the JEE results for talking time out to connect with me and help
me out: you guys are the read MVP's! Finally, thanks to anybody I missed out on 
here and who has been a part of this journey: this includes my friends, family
members and anybody who directly or indirectly guided me.

&lt;p&gt;A lot has been said about &lt;a href="https://www.concepts-of-physics.com/concepts-of-physics.php"&gt;Concepts of Physics&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. H. C.Verma and it's usefulness for JEE Preparation. The website itself claims that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot has been said about &lt;a href="https://www.concepts-of-physics.com/concepts-of-physics.php"&gt;Concepts of Physics&lt;/a&gt; by Dr. H. C.Verma and it's usefulness for JEE Preparation. The website itself claims that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students from the past twenty years of JEE preparation used this book and have successfully cleared JEE. So, you cannot neglect this book. A common problem that was observed with many JEE aspirants is that they follow multiple books in parallel, thereby ending up in confusion. Follow only one book at a time and make sure it is reputed one like Concepts of Physics by HC Verma. You may consults other books too but not at the cost of creating more confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, this website is not endorsed by Dr. H. C. Verma himself. It seems to be made by a third party looking to sell their own books, in conjunction with Dr. Verma's. I have nothing against the book itself: as far as physics books go, it is brilliantly formatted and lucidly explained. It's a great introduction to Physics for several physics noobs, including me. Let me repeat that again:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concepts of Physics is a great introductory book for people who are not good at physics.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone starts out a learner. It's fine to use a book like this when you're learning. However, this book has almost zero applicability when it comes to preparing for JEE(A). It might get you through JEE(M), but it's extremely risky to refer to ONLY this book and accept it's word as the word of god. Here are a few reasons not to use Concepts of Physics for long term preparation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It's not exam-oriented!&lt;/strong&gt; This has to be the biggest gripe of mine. The book's content has not kept up with the demands of the exam, but that is not it's purpose. However, people still believe that it has kept up and is still as relevant as it was 20 years ago. The Single Correct and Multiple Correct questions (Objective I and Objective II) are mainly concept oriented, with no numericals. Even the subjective questions suck big time, compared to Irodov or Krotov. Here's a snap of Chapter 18, Geometrical Optics:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;&lt;img alt="chapter 18" src="https://aniruddha-deb.github.io/articles/2020/res/chp18_optics.png"&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Notice that questions 61-66 are exactly the same with the only difference being the type of lens and mirror in the situation and the parameter being asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It covers irrelevant concepts!&lt;/strong&gt; TVF made a point of this in their skit "A Day with H C Verma". Chapter 47, Relativity, is not included in syllabus. A lot of other concepts, such as Peltier effect, Zeeman effect, measuring speed of light etc are irrelevant from an exam point of view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It does not cover relevant concepts!&lt;/strong&gt; Some concepts such as force on a dielectric (question 74 of Capacitors chapter) are not explained in the textbook and are left to the students to solve. Angular momentum (one of the most important concepts, see JEE(A) 2016) is paid a lip service in Rotational motion, with one big mathematical derivation explaining the whole concept.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I already mentioned, Concepts of physics is a great physics book, which is often the entry point of many students into the world of Higher Secondary Physics. However, I am tired of self-proclaimed 'gurus' and other JEE toppers proclaiming that this book is all you need to crack the exam. This is a blatant lie. &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="JEE"></category><category term="JEE"></category><category term="Physics"></category></entry></feed>
