* Add ``pyproject.toml``, managed by Poetry
* Support for invoking ``python -m pelican``

==================

* Refactor ``pelican.server`` logging
* Fix bug in which all static files were processed as "draft"
* Bug fixes for Invoke/Makefile automation, Importer, and other miscellanea

If upgrading from 3.7.x or earlier, please note that slug-related settings in
4.0+ use ``{slug}`` and/or ``{lang}`` rather than ``%s``. If ``%s``-style
settings are encountered, Pelican will emit a warning and fall back to the
default setting. Some user-submitted themes might try to format setting values
but fail upon site build with a ``TypeError``. In such cases, the theme needs
to be updated. For example, instead of ``TAG_FEED_ATOM|format(tag.slug)``, use
``TAG_FEED_ATOM.format(slug=tag.slug)``

4.0.0 (2018-11-13)
==================

* Replace ``develop_server.sh`` script with ``pelican --listen``

  ``STATIC_PATHS``
* Pages can now have ``draft`` status
* Show current settings via new ``--print-settings`` flag
* All settings for slugs now use ``{slug}`` and/or ``{lang}`` rather than

* New signals: ``feed_generated`` and ``page_generated_write_page``
* Replace Fabric with Invoke and ``fabfile.py`` template with ``tasks.py``
* Replace ``PAGINATED_DIRECT_TEMPLATES`` by ``PAGINATED_TEMPLATES``, extending
  control over pagination to all templates and making page size variable
* Replace ``SLUG_SUBSTITUTIONS`` (and friends) by ``SLUG_REGEX_SUBSTITUTIONS``
  for more finegrained control
* ``'{base_name}'`` value in ``PAGINATION_PATTERNS`` setting no longer strips
  ``'bar'`` from ``'foo/bar.html'`` (unless ``'bar' == 'index'``).
* ``ARTICLE_ORDER_BY`` and ``PAGE_ORDER_BY`` now also affect 1) category, tag
  and author pages 2) feeds 3) draft and hidden articles and pages

  specify metadata attributes used to identify/disable translations
* Make the HTML reader parse multiple occurrences of metadata tags as a list
* New Blogger XML backup importer
* Wordpress importer now updates file links to point to local copies if the
  files were downloaded with ``--wp-attach``.
* Importer no longer inserts extra newlines, to prevent breaking of HTML
