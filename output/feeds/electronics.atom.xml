&lt;h3&gt;Flip-Flop: Concept&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Flip flop is a one-bit storage device which looks somewhat like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="flip flop" src="https://aniruddha-deb.github.io/articles/2018/res/flip_flop.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The truth table of this device looks somewhat like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="truth table" src="https://aniruddha-deb.github.io/articles/2018/res/jk-flip-flop-truth-table.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the flip flop toggles only on the rising edge of the clock. Therefore, in order to clock down the frequency by 2, we need to set the J and K bits high and feed the clock signal in to the CLK pin, thereby obtaining a 1Hz signal on the Q pin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Adding the flip-flop to our circuit:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On adding the flip flop to our circuit, the schematic looks somewhat like this (The 4060 has been carried over from the previous post):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="1hz schematic" src="https://aniruddha-deb.github.io/articles/2018/res/1hz_schematic.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As calculated, this gives us a frequency of 1 Hz on the Q pin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="oscilloscope output" src="https://aniruddha-deb.github.io/articles/2018/res/pic.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This concludes our clock signal source. In the next post, we will have a look at counting seconds with the clock signal. &lt;/p&gt;

In this installment, I'm going to engineer the clock signal generator, the most crucial part of our clock&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Importance of the Signal in a clock&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every clock is only as accurate as it's signal. An &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_clock"&gt;atomic clock&lt;/a&gt; uses radiations emitted by cesium-133 as it's signal, a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_clock"&gt;quartz clock&lt;/a&gt; uses a 32768 Hz quartz crystal as it's signal whereas a mechanical clock uses an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escapement"&gt;Escapement&lt;/a&gt; powered by a hairspring (in wristwatches) or by a pendulum (in clocks). The signal has a cascading effect on the accuracy of a clock - even a 0.1% divergence in the period of the second hand causes a clock to lose or gain 86.4 seconds a day, or in larger terms, lose or gain almost half a day in a year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Make an accurate electronic signal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our clock (like most other clocks) is going to use a quartz crystal as it's main signal. An &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RC_oscillator"&gt;RC&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LC_circuit"&gt;LC&lt;/a&gt; oscillator cannot be an accurate signal as the frequency will change with changes in temperature. Also, tuning an RC/LC oscillator to an exact frequency requires a ton of precision - the frequency has to be within a standard deviation of ±0.01%&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The signal generated by this crystal has a frequency of 32768 Hz, which isn't very useful to us. In order to use it to drive the seconds counter, we must scale it down to 1 Hz (1 pulse per second). In order to do this, I will use a HEF4060, which is a 14 bit binary ripple counter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The HEF4060 has the capacity to give us a minimum frequency of 32768/214 = 2 Hz. This will later be scaled down using a flip-flop to give us a frequency of 1 Hz. The circuit for this looks like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Clock circuit" src="https://aniruddha-deb.github.io/articles/2018/res/clock_signal_schematic.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After testing the above circuit on a breadboard, pin 7 (Q4) gave the following results on an oscilloscope:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="oscilloscope" src="https://aniruddha-deb.github.io/articles/2018/res/pic_44_3.bmp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These results were expected as 32768/16 gives us 2048, which is approximately 2.049 kHz. the extra 1 Hz is probably a result of breadboard capacitance, which should go away once the circuit is soldered on a PCB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next installment, I will use a flip flop to halve the 2Hz signal to give us a resultant signal of 1Hz, which can be used to drive the seconds counter.&lt;/p&gt;

Make sure you're subscribed to the RSS feed so that you don't miss out on anything!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An electronic clock is a good project for intermediate to advanced electronic hobbyists, which is why I decided to build one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first task is enumerating the requirements of the clock. A humble requirement list looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clock should run on a few AA cells&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should have a 24 hour display&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should display seconds, minutes and hours&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should have two LED's each to separate the hours, minutes and seconds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should be moderately compact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It should be challenging to engineer and design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second task is deciding what components will form the base of the clock (akin to choosing a language or a technology stack for developing an application). For a clock, a few options are available:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a microcontroller:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Interface a DS1307 clock module with the microcontroller using SPI, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write your own code for a real-time clock in the microcontroller and use an external clock crystal (already done this here)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use CMOS/TTL Logic IC's&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with the second option as I had already written code for a microcontroller clock and gone halfway through the implementation when I realized that it was too easy and did not provide a challenge. If you are a beginner, you should take the microcontroller route, as in case of bugs, they are easily rectifiable via your code, whereas debugging a hardware circuit (especially a large CMOS/TTL one) is decently hard for beginners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within a few minutes, I drew a basic block diagram for the main components in the circuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://aniruddha-deb.github.io/articles/2018/res/disp.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The circuit mainly consists of a 1Hz signal generator, a few counters/dividers and the display logic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next segment, I'm going to build the signal generator and produce an accurate 2Hz signal that can be used by the other counters.&lt;/p&gt;
