I had been using MyLifeOrganized in a virtual machine on my mac, but it just wasn't cutting it. Things 3 and OmniFocus for Mac were too pricey and other web-based todo apps like Trello and Todoist didn't suit me very much. As a result, I decided to jump into some code and create a custom to-do mac app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My basic requirements were very humble: I need a task list in which I can create, read, update and delete tasks easily. I eventually decided to go with a unix-like command line application. Unix apps are usually made in C or Shell Script. My C is pathetic at the very least and I find shell script to be.. Queer. Java was too heavyweight a language to code a simple shell utility in, so I chose to go with Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had minimal experience with python in the past. I barely knew the basic language constructs and features. Luckily, python has a very shallow learning curve. About two hours with google and my python concepts were acceptable enough to start coding. Initially, python felt very much like shell script, just slightly more verbose. The lack of semicolons in python still irritates a Java programmer like me and the absence of braces makes the code feel very different compared to Java. After a few days of coding, these features started to grow on me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first draft of GTD.py was a disaster. I used a text file to store all the application data and there was a ton of File I/O involved. Combine that with me using the google python fire library like an amateur and things quickly went downhill. Every time the code ran, it threw a horrendous looking python exception at my face (coming from java, python exceptions are much more beautiful compared to terrible.java.Stack.traces). Python looked like a terrible choice of language, as I could have a similar Java program up and running in about 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, though, my comfort with the language grew. I ditched the text based approach and decided to use an SQLite database to store the information. I also discarded python fire and chose to use argparse. These two libraries gave me a decent challenge to build the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second draft came out much better than the first. The program is now usable (still needs a little refactoring). At the time of writing, I am still getting used to python programming conventions (reserved_chars as opposed to reservedChars) and the strange looking import statements. The language is still much less verbose as compared to Java and with enough practice, I may end up being more productive in Python. There's still a long way to go - I barely know the standard libraries and the functions. I also need to get to know the python runtime well enough before I start coding serious application critical components in python. The initial impression of python as a language for me was decently good. Would be interesting to see where I stand in about two to three months with the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out the GTD.py code &lt;a href="https://github.com/Aniruddha-Deb/GTD.py"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good luck to all those starting their python journey!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I got my first taste of this quiz when I was in eighth standard. I sheepishly went up to the head of department of computers and said that I was interested in participating in the TCS IT Wiz. After an announcement in class about the quiz, all the scholars in the class soon followed suit. Looking back, I barely knew anything about IT then. Around 30 of us were put in a bus and taken to the venue, where we managed to get a balcony seat. I couldn't answer more than 8 questions correctly. It was a complete disaster&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a year, and I was ready to tackle the quiz head-on another time. However, a science exhibition was held on the same day as that of the quiz, and I chose (and won) the science exhibition. Fast forward another year, and I am now Pune champion. How time flies!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year, I was well aware of the quiz and did a moderate amount of preparation before the regionals. TCS uploads the regional finals of every city, so going through them and getting a feel of the questions and the rounds is essential. Preparation time also needs to be devoted to TCS itself - There is a round dedicated completely to it. Going over their website (thoroughly) and their wikipedia page should be adequate for the regionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were among the first to reach the venue and were seated pretty far ahead. This time, when Pickbrain came on stage in his usual kurta, I was well prepared. With a score of 12 in the prelims, I successfully managed to get on stage along with my teammate, Rasesh. Well acquainted with the format of the quiz, we played along well and managed to top the quiz with a score of 40. UWC Mahindra college were runners up, with a score of 35. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after the quiz was over, the very next day, we drew up a schedule of preparation. Going over last year's regional finals was top priority, followed by researching about companies and new technology trends. Close observation of our competitors was also on the back of our minds as we continued researching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The quiz finals are held on 10th December every year, at Taj Lands End in Mumbai. This was the first time I was in a TCS National final, up against stiff competition from last time's winners. Due to hasty decisions, we were knocked out of the quiz during the semifinal stage, getting a +1 and then a -1, bringing our score to 0. Delhi and Ahmedabad got 4 or 5 and Kochi got 1. The finals were a close contested battle between Delhi and Ahmedabad up till the fifth round. In the fifth round, Delhi built up an unassailable 30 point lead and went on to win the quiz again, with a score of 80 to Ahmedabad's 40. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tata Consultancy Services are very generous with prizes. All national finalists got 35,000 rupees in Amazon gift vouchers, whereas the runner up got 1,00,000 and the winners received 1,50,000. Even though I lost, the experience in Mumbai will be unforgettable. Hope to come back next year and give Pranav from DPS Noida some stiff competition!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watch the 2017 national finals &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3VsvX1Ateys"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of luck for next year's quiz!&lt;/p&gt;

Googling it up reveals a few obscure links. It doesn't even have a Wikipedia page of it's own! Safety science is a new term that refers to the science of keeping oneself safe from dangers at home, at work, on the streets and so on. This concept of safety science is spearheaded in India by Underwriters Laboratories (&lt;em&gt;whispers&lt;/em&gt; marketing) in association with NDTV (&lt;em&gt;whispers&lt;/em&gt; TRP.).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got the first taste of this quiz last year, when I was in ninth grade. It was the first 'web quiz' of sorts that I had given (p.s.: cheating is very easy, only that I realized it after my quiz was over). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not qualify from the school (top 2 qualify for regional finals) and ultimately stayed back. This year though, I somehow managed to top the school and got 24 out of 25. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By a stroke of luck, I had done minimal preparation for the quiz and managed to go on stage. Playing the stage round wisely and steadily, I amazingly managed to win this round. This was the typical 'what the hell, I was not expecting this to happen' moment. We then had to travel to Delhi from 29th of November to the 3rd of December, which was right in the thick of our exams. After juggling the exams out of the way, we were on our way to Delhi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On reaching Delhi, a welcome dinner was hosted on the 29th. We then had a safety parliament shoot (read: TRP) on the 30th, when a panel of safety experts came on stage and we had to ask them questions on the state of safety in India(more on this in a later blog). After a long night of preparation, we had our semifinals the following day. An aura of nervousness prevailed around all the participants as we got ready for the second semifinal, where we were pitted against the likes of winners and runner ups from Delhi, Jaipur, Bangalore and Calcutta. Ultimately, we managed to lose and dropped to last while the runner ups from Delhi managed to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a case of history repeating itself, as Chettinad Vidyaashram from Chennai, the winners of last year's national finals, won again this time. DAV Chennai, last year's runner ups, came runner up again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have successfully survived my drunk rambling about the quiz, this is a step by step guide on how I prepared: 
The first step is the web quiz. If you really want it that bad, just open up a new tab and google the questions in the quiz. Make sure you get above 20 out of 25 in the quiz.
The top four people from each school participate in teams of two. Make sure you tie up with a person whom you are comfortable with. For good strategy, inform your expected teammate to prepare and do his best in the web round, so that the two of you are in the top four people.
The prelims of the regional finals are going to be the hardest questions in the entire journey. Prepare hard for the regional finals. The minute you qualify on stage, it is a cakewalk.
On stage, three out of four rounds are on 'pounce', that is, if another person gets an easy question, any team on stage can pounce and answer that question and will get +10 for a right and -7 for a wrong. The question remains open after you pounce, so all other teams can still answer the question. 
It is confidence that will carry you through the stage rounds. The questions on stage are comparatively very easy. Do not be afraid to pounce on each and every question on stage. Pounce hard and victory will be yours.
The national semifinals are a completely different game. Every question is on buzzer. There are 10 questions spread over 4 rounds. The rounds are arranged according to the table below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;No.&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Num Questions&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Points per question&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Notes&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;±10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Single questions &lt;br&gt;1 normal question &lt;br&gt;2 anagram questions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;±20&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Double questions &lt;br&gt;2 picture based questions &lt;br&gt;1 true/false question&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;±50&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5 part questions &lt;br&gt;1 true/false question &lt;br&gt;1 word maze &lt;br&gt;1 spot the safety hazards question&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;*/2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Make or break question: can double or halve all your points &lt;br&gt;5 part question &lt;br&gt;All 5 parts need to be correct to double &lt;br&gt;Question type: Match the symbols to their meanings&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till now, nobody who has attempted a make or break question has won the quiz. Everyone gets four right and one wrong
The right strategy for the semifinal and final is to be quick on the buzzer and make minimal mistakes. Attempt the make or break question only if you are in dire conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few important topics to prepare on are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fire extinguishers and their classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and their types and classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safety symbols (make or break question)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terms related to safety (word maze)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Picture recognition (for safety hazards)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Safety news (products banned for dangerous chemicals etc.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best of luck for the quiz!&lt;/p&gt;
