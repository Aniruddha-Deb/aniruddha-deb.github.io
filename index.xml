      <title>Luck, Skill or Both: Department Change at IITs</title>

      <description>A friend recently asked me to provide some advice on department change to some freshers. The usual fundaebaazi is something I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do; it&amp;rsquo;s not impressionable, and won&amp;rsquo;t motivate any fresher to study for a department change. Instead, I chose to show and not tell
So is it luck or skill? Short answer: Both.
Let&amp;rsquo;s look at how first year courses are graded. For most theory courses (3 lecture hours + 1 tutorial hour / 2 lab hours), there&amp;rsquo;s a normal distribution of marks, and the top 7% of people on this distribution get an A.</description>

      <description>Remember last semester, where I said this?
That went pretty well. Much better than I expected it to go :) I also used the HPC DL environment a lot, across 4 courses that I did (COL380, COL772, COL775 and COD310). It was so used that at a point I had four different GPU&amp;rsquo;s allocated just for running tasks for these different courses.
A lot could be done better, though. Since I have my summer ahead of me, I decided to clean house for the next semester</description>

      <description>The title is (obviously) a shout out to Jay Alammar&amp;rsquo;s Blog, which is probably the best source to learn about transformers, followed by The Annotated Transformer. Both of them are unclear about the nuances though (where the dropouts are mostly), and so I made this to clear that up.
PS: Yes, this is just the encoder stack. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably make the decoder stack in a part 2?</description>

      <description>My 2015 MBP 13&amp;quot; was giving me some pain over this entire semester, lagging a lot and being very slow overall. I recently upgraded to a 16&amp;quot; MBP, and there have been no complaints so far :) the notch is simply not there if you have a black desktop background, so +1 to apple for that. Although face ID would have been nice to have.

      <title>Batch Normalization</title>
      <link>https://aniruddhadeb.com/articles/2023/batch-normalization/</link>

      <description>$$ \require{physics} \newcommand{B}{\mathcal{B}}$$
Batch Normalization was proposed by Ioffe and Szegedy in 2015, and it spawned several normalization techniques that are used in SOTA models today (layer norm, weight norm, etc). Batch normalization normalizes the output of each layer based on the mean and variance of the examples in the current batch. Formally, if $\B = {x_1, \ldots, x_m}$ is our batch, then batch norm does the following transformation:
$$\begin{align} \mu_{\B} &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{m} \sum_i x_i \\ \sigma_{\B}^2 &amp;amp;= \left( \frac{1}{m} \sum_i x_i^2 \right) - \mu_{\B}^2 \\ \hat{x}_i &amp;amp;= \frac{x_i - \mu_{\B}}{\sqrt{\sigma^2_{\B} + \epsilon}} \\ y_i &amp;amp;= \gamma \hat{x}_i + \beta \end{align}$$</description>

      <title>L2 regularization intuition</title>
      <link>https://aniruddhadeb.com/articles/2023/l2-regularization/</link>

      <guid>https://aniruddhadeb.com/articles/2023/l2-regularization/</guid>
      <description>A nice intuition for L2 regularization comes from having a prior on the distribution of parameters: the prior assumes that the parameters are close to zero. Let&amp;rsquo;s assume that the prior is $\mathcal{N}(0, \Sigma)$. The MAP estimate of the parameters would then be
$$\begin{align} \theta_{\text{MAP}} &amp;amp;= \text{argmax}_{\theta} ; P(\theta | D) \\ &amp;amp;= \text{argmax}_{\theta} ; P(D | \theta) P(\theta) \\ &amp;amp;= \text{argmax}_{\theta} ; \log P(D | \theta) + \log P(\theta) \end{align}$$</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve kind of zeroed down on Deep Learning at this point, and putting my money where my mouth is, will be taking both COL772 (Natural Language Processing) and COL775 (Deep Learning) next semester.
Along with Operating Systems, Parallel Programming and Theory of Computation.
Why a workflow? I&amp;rsquo;ll need to train a lot of models, and while Kaggle and Colab are great at this, 30 hours a week won&amp;rsquo;t cut it. So I&amp;rsquo;ll need to move to using the IITD HPC to train some (most?</description>

      <description>Some of you might have come across HackerFX, an image binarizer. This was written a long time back, when the only language I knew was Java, and when I was still in school.
An update was on the cards for a while, because I wanted to change my desktop background (which still looks surprisingly pretty for something made so long ago). I started playing around with PIL today evening to update this, and the end result is HackerFX v2, a python rewrite that supports multicoloured input images, hex, file dumps, variable colors and a manual 5x5 font for the output charactes (so the aspect ratio doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be manually tweaked).</description>

      <guid>https://aniruddhadeb.com/articles/2022/boot-deep-dive/</guid>
      <description>The Basics The most basic boot process is BIOS on a standard i386/x86-64 device. The BIOS first detects the CPU/RAM, then initializes the remainder of the hardware, and then begins the boot sequence. The boot sequence basically consists of finding a bootable device, loading the boot program in that bootable device into the processor cache and letting the processor do it&amp;rsquo;s thing.
How is a bootable device found? A device is considered bootable if it has the magic bytes 0x55 and 0xaa at offsets 511 and 512 from the start.</description>

Recap If you remember the note on random variables, then this picks up exactly where that left off.
Definition 1.1: A Measurable space $(X,\Sigma)$ consists of a set $X$ and a $\sigma$-algebra $\Sigma$ defined on $X$.
Recall that a $\sigma$-algebra is simply a collection of subsets over $X$ that is closed over unions, intersections and complements.
Definition 1.2: If $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are $\sigma$-algebras defined on $\Omega$ and $\mathcal{B} \subseteq \mathcal{A}$, then $\mathcal{B}$ is a sub $\sigma$-algebra of $\mathcal{A}$</description>

      <guid>https://aniruddhadeb.com/articles/2022/simple-sudoku-solver/</guid>
      <description>The Problem The problem is a simple search problem: given a partially filled sudoku board, return a fully filled sudoku board with the initial numbers in place such that each digit features only once in every row, column and 3x3 subgrid.
The Solution These problems, in general, are called Constraint Satisfaction Problems. Given a set of constraints, find a valid solution which satisfies all the constraints.
A CSP is generally represented as a graph, with each variable as a node and a constraint between two variables as an edge.</description>

      <description>Most of the times, the regression models we need to fit don&amp;rsquo;t have a constant standard deviation, but rather one that is some function of $x$. In this article, I try to learn a model with variance varying linearly as a function of x: kind of like a &lt;em&gt;regression on variance&lt;/em&gt;</description>

      <description>Not everything goes exactly as planned. That&amp;rsquo;s why it&amp;rsquo;s a plan, not a certainty.
Aiming in Before this entire joomla started, I asked myself: What is it I want from an intern?
I wanted to tour: I didn&amp;rsquo;t pick up a foreign research intern this summer, and was tired of hearing/seeing how others were roaming the world while I was scooping shuttles off the floor of my room. I wanted something that paid well: Apart from the feel-good factor, a good paying intern would put money for my masters&amp;rsquo; in the bank Above both of these:</description>

      <description>For the upcoming semesters, we have a ton of systems courses. So, I needed a linux box that I could hack around, preferably at the kernel level. I finally got around to installing Arch Linux on a Raspberry Pi1: Here&amp;rsquo;s how I did it.
Context For starters, I already use linux/unix systems quite a bit. The real need for a linux system became apparent last semester, when one of our courses needed a program that would run only on Windows/Ubuntu.</description>

Consider $X \sim \text{Uniform}([0,1])$. What is $\cP{X &amp;gt; \frac{1}{2}}{X \in \mathbb{Q}}$ ?
At first glance, the answer seems simple: it’s 1/2! Closer inspection reveals that the event $X \in \mathbb{Q}$ is not measurable: the rationals have measure zero, hence from our high-school (perhaps even undergraduate) definition of conditional probability, the given probability should be undefined. However, the conditional probability does exist, and it equals 1/2.</description>

      <description>$\newcommand{\triple}{(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbf{P})}$$\newcommand{\P}{\mathbf{P}}$ This note on random variables follows as a result of confusing notation in several math textbooks. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain random variables (in measure theoretic terms) as verbosely as I can, and then prove some results. This article assumes that the reader is familiar with probability triples $\triple$, as well as a basic idea of what random variables are, in non-measure theory terms.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll begin this article by brushing up a few definitions:
A function is a mapping between two sets: the domain D and the codomain C.
It&amp;rsquo;s very important to note here that the function is the mapping itself, and not an element in the codomain or the domain. The function operates on an element in the domain to give an element in the codomain. Formally, we would write this function as $f:D \to C$</description>

      <description>C development on a Mac has it&amp;rsquo;s fair share of traps and pitfalls, even though Mac is supposed to be POSIX compliant. I&amp;rsquo;ll cover a few of them here, with the hope that nobody repeats the same mistakes :)
XCode CLT Pitfalls The first thing one does while starting out with C development is to install a compiler. This is slightly more complicated than it looks on Mac: the simple way is to go the way of installing XCode command line tools, but there&amp;rsquo;s a few things here to note:</description>

The Jacobian Matrix Consider a function that maps reals to reals, $f:\Bbb{R} \to \Bbb{R}$. The linear approximation of this function is given by $$f(a+h) \approx f(a) + hf&amp;rsquo;(a)$$ This is pretty simple to do, and follows from taylor&amp;rsquo;s expansion upto the first order.
Let&amp;rsquo;s try expanding this concept to vector spaces. For a function $f:\Bbb{R}^n \to \Bbb{R}$, it&amp;rsquo;s linear approximation is given by $$f(\pmb{a} + \pmb{h}) \approx f(\pmb{a}) + \pmb{h}\cdot\nabla{f}(\a)$$ (bold type indicates vectors).</description>

      <description>I started reading CS theory in anticipation of my upcoming curriculum and I found that CLRS starts the reader off with sort algorithms (technically they start with math and basic CS, but I&amp;rsquo;ve already covered that). I decided to make a Sorting testbench, whose requirements were pretty simple:
It should be able to generate arrays of a given entropy: the entropy of an array is defined as the number of swaps required to sort the array.</description>

      <description>For IIT admissions, I had created a small command line tool called iit_dep_finder.py to check the departments I would get, given a particular rank. Once the round one allocation results came out, I decided to create a web version, for others to use as well. This article chronicles the steps I took, and while I did get the department finder up and running, I also did a lot of other stuff in the process (including changing the domain name, in case you haven&amp;rsquo;t noticed :).</description>

      <description>I think an update on the JEE Situation has been due for a long time, and I&amp;rsquo;ll try to compress the past few months into this single post. Long story short, my JEE(M) was held on 2nd September, in the evening shift. After giving my best and getting a 260/300, I was disappointed (putting it mildly) to see the CRL of 1861 on my screen. AITS JEE(A) Mocks followed, and after giving three of them, I had to give my BITSAT.</description>

System Setup Log My MacBook battery started to swell around a year back, and the machine became unusable 6 months ago and was put into temporary hibernation. Post my exams, I did a battery replacement and the computer was out of the hospital today, with a fresh operating system and a formatted disk.</description>

      <description>This is a small set of posts that come into the category of &amp;ldquo;notes&amp;rdquo;: self-explanations of concepts that I have recently picked up and found interesting.
Lagrange Interpolation Lagrange Interpolation is a concept that allows us to find a polynomial of least degree passing through a given set of points. Specifically:
If $S = {(x_i, y_i) : x_i, y_i \in R, 1 \lt i \le n}$, then the polynomial of least degree passing through all the points in $S$ is given by $$P(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n L_i(x) \cdot y_i$$ where $$L_i(x) = \frac{(x-x_1)(x-x_2)&amp;hellip;(x-x_{i-1})(x-x_{i+1})&amp;hellip;(x-x_n)} {(x_i-x_1)(x_i-x_2)&amp;hellip;(x_i-x_{i-1})(x_i-x_{i+1})&amp;hellip;(x_i-x_n)}$$ or simply, $$P(x) = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\prod_{r \ne i}(x-x_r)}{\prod_{r \ne i}{(x_i-x_r)}} \cdot y_i$$ note that the degree of polynomial $P &amp;lt; n$.</description>

      <description>My old man always used to say that there are two ways to solve a problem: there&amp;rsquo;s the horse way, and there&amp;rsquo;s the donkey way. The donkey way involves tedious calculations, whereas the horse way &amp;lsquo;cuts&amp;rsquo; through the problem. Take this problem as an example:
For each positive integer $n$, let $$y_n = ((n+1)(n+2)&amp;hellip;(n+n))^\frac1n$$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$. Let $[x]$ be the greatest integer less than or equal to $x$. If $\lim_{n \to \infty} y_n = L$, then the value of $[L]$ is ______ ?</description>

C: Debu, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t solve that African integral you gave me.
Me: Ok, but why are you calling it African?
C: Because Africa is a really big continent, y&amp;rsquo;know?
Me: Ok, but isn&amp;rsquo;t Asia bigger?
C: Debu, please stop making me feel dumb</description>

      <title>Limit involving higher order infinitesimals</title>

      <guid>https://aniruddhadeb.com/articles/2020/limit-higher-order-infinitesimals/</guid>
      <description>Simple limit problems consist of the form $\lim_{x \to 0}\frac{O_1(x)O_2(x)..}{O_a(x)O_b(x)..}$, such as $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac{\sin 3x \tan 2x \tan^{-1} 5x}{x^2 \ln(1+x)}$. Here, the infinitesimals are well defined and cancel out easily. Some trickier limit problems involve the difference of two infinitesimals. A good example is $\lim_{t \to 0} \frac{\sin t - \tan t}{t^3}$. These kind of problems require expansions to solve them cleanly. L&amp;rsquo;Hopital rule is tedious as it will need to be repeated atleast thrice for this given limit, which involves infinitesimals of order 3.</description>

      <description>Define $ f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c , a,b,c \in \mathbb{R}$ and $ f^n(x) = f(f^{n-1}(x)), n&amp;gt;1 $. Prove that the real roots of $ f^n(x) $ are symmetric about the vertical line passing through vertex i.e. $ x = \frac{-b}{2a} $
This seems like a complicated problem. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by first making intuitional sense of this problem. We can say that $ f^n(x) $ will be a polynomial of the order $ 2^n $ and will have as many roots.</description>

      <description>Evaluate the integral $$\int_0^1 \frac{\log(x)}{x-1}dx$$
There are a few methods of doing this: the first one uses the taylor series expansion of \( \log(1-x) \): $$I = -\int_0^1 \frac{\log(1-x)}{x}dx$$ $$I = \int_0^1 \frac 1x \left( x + \frac{x^2}{2} + \frac{x^3}{3} + &amp;hellip; \right) $$
This expression nicely integrates to give $$I = 1 + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + &amp;hellip; = \boxed{\frac{\pi^2}{6}}$$
The last step here involves the summation \( \zeta(2) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac 1 {k^2} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}\).</description>

      <description>An interesting electronics problem I encountered recently was this: Find the resistance between points A and B in the following resistor network
This looks like a simple wheatstone bridge problem, but note that the top right and bottom left resistances are R and not r. To solve this problem, we&amp;rsquo;ll use the concept of symmetry and a few tricks. Let&amp;rsquo;s start by connecting a battery to the circuit and labeling the currents and loops</description>

      <description>This is a test to see if MathJax works on blogger.
For \(\alpha, \beta \gt -1\), find the value of \(\lim_{n \to \infty} n^{\beta - \alpha} \frac{1^\alpha + 2^\alpha + 3^\alpha + &amp;hellip; + n^\alpha}{1^\beta + 2^\beta + 3^\beta + &amp;hellip; + n^\beta}\)
So we have
$$L = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{n^\beta}{n^\alpha} \times \frac{\sum_{r=0}^n r^\alpha}{\sum_{r=0}^n r^\beta}\ = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{\sum_{r=0}^n (\frac rn)^\alpha}{\sum_{r=0}^n (\frac rn)^\beta}$$
The summations can now be evaluated as Riemann sums by multiplying numerator and denominator by (\frac 1n)</description>

      <description>In the previous post, we saw how to make a 2Hz clock signal. However, for the seconds counter, we will need a 1Hz clock signal. In order to achieve this, I will clock down the frequency using a JK Flip Flop:
###Flip-Flop: Concept A Flip flop is a one-bit storage device which looks somewhat like this:
The truth table of this device looks somewhat like this:
Note that the flip flop toggles only on the rising edge of the clock.</description>

###Importance of the Signal in a clock Every clock is only as accurate as it&amp;rsquo;s signal. An atomic clock uses radiations emitted by cesium-133 as it&amp;rsquo;s signal, a quartz clock uses a 32768 Hz quartz crystal as it&amp;rsquo;s signal whereas a mechanical clock uses an Escapement powered by a hairspring (in wristwatches) or by a pendulum (in clocks).</description>
